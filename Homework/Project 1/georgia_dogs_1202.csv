Everybody meet Bubbles! Bubbles is one third of our PowerPuff Girls Trio. They were found dumped in a box one morning outside of our building.

She has grown up in our rescue, and it is time for her to have a home of her own! Bubbles is crate trained and is partially house broken. She is good with other dogs, but probably should avoid a home with small children only because she is silly and might knock them down.

Snow has been in the shelter waiting for a home for years.

We don’t know why we have had no interest in this sweet guy. He is an all around good and happy boy that absolutely loves peanut butter, treats, and snuggles. Snow does not get along with all dogs, so he would probably do best in a home with no other pets or he will at least need to meet the other pets before adoption. Snow would also do best in a home with no small children, as we fear children would be too stressful for this guy. This could also be shelter-related stress behavior, but we want Snow to be in a home where he is comfortable and happy.

Please give this guy a chance at a life outside of the shelter. He deserves to live out the rest of his life in a home, not a run.

Sawyer is a clown. He is very athletic and energetic, this boy LOVES to play with anyone willing. Sawyer also enjoys playing with other dogs in our program. His play can get too rough for some dogs. His play behavior is vigorous and fast. He can jump like a kangaroo! This dog could be a gold medal dock jumping champion with some training.

With sufficient outdoor physical exercise, when inside, Sawyer is calm and well mannered. We will be looking for a home with a yard that is fully enclosed with a tall fence (at least 6') to keep him safe and allow for vigorous outdoor exercise he needs.

Sawyer is very smart and has learned his cues well. Sit, down, stay, wait for food and at doors, give, leave it, go to your spot. He is house and crate trained. He enjoys ""working"" and being challenged with mental and physical games. This dog can ""go"" all day long and never tire out. No couch potato, Sawyer needs an active person or family.

Sawyer is respectful of his trainer's belongings in the room. He does have a cardboard fetish, so we have removed all cardboard from his room.

Sawyer is loved by all the staff and inmates in his dorm because he is so accepting and loving of each of them.

Because of Sawyer's play energy, we will be looking for a home without cats or other small animals or young children. He is determined to ""catch"" what he chases.

Zack is a happy, friendly, playful, highly athletic, energetic and very smart boy. He considers you a friend (unless a person is mean to him) and gets along very well with other dogs in our program.

Zack is house and crate trained. He has learned his cues of sit, down, wait, give, leave it, stay, go to his spot, Zack is quiet, clean and a ""leaner"". You may not receive many kisses from this boy, he prefers cuddling with his person.

Zack's favorite thing is to fetch the ball outside in the fenced yard. He will go as long as you allow him to. Of equal enjoyment is a good game of ""tug"" with his trainer. We teach a special kind of tug that trains our dogs to ""let go"" on cue. Once Zack is well exercised, he walks nicely on the leash.

We are looking for a home with a good size fully fenced yard in order to get the amount of physical exercise Zack needs. He could not get sufficient exercise by just walking him.

Inside, Zack is calm and quiet. When he does bark, it is an alert for his trainer that someone is at the door of their cell. Zack's bark is impressive and no criminal with a working brain would try to break into his house! Once the visitor is welcomed inside, Zack is his usual friendly self.

Zack is respectful of his trainer's property. He enjoys playing with his stuffed squeaky toys (which he does not destroy) or chewing on his XLarge Bambone while his trainer reads a book. A very visual dog, Zack is constantly watchful of what is going on around him.

Zack came from a quiet home with an older couple who surrendered him to the local shelter due to stated financial struggles. He is a real ""home body"" and likes to keep his world small and quiet. Zack has been challenged in the prison which is consistently very noisy and crowded. He would do best in a calmer environment without crowds or loud yelling and loud noise, both which are abundant in prison. This boy especially loves women!"

Rico is a low maintenance, well-adjusted happy boy who loves every human and most med-large dogs he meets. Very tolerant, sweet and friendly, he loves to be around people. He reads other dogs well and adjusts his interactions appropriately. No small animals for Rico.

Rico is one of the first 2 dogs in our program that started in 2015. Rico and his pal Billy were adopted by a former employee of the prison. They lived a good life for 5 years.

Sadly in November 2020, their mom left the marriage and relocated out of state. Rico and Billy remained with their dad in Georgia.

Tragically, just before Christmas 2020, their dad passed away in his sleep, leaving the boys homeless. When their dad's body was found, the boys were taken to the Morgan County Animal Shelter. We were notified the evening of December 20th and went the next morning to pick them up. Billy has since been adopted.

Rico enjoys being outside as long as it's not raining. He is not a water dog. A bit prissy about getting wet, he heaves a big sigh, and tolerates bath time.

Rico's calm temperament and sweetness has brought much delight to all the inmates and officers who live and work in his dorm.

Rico has excellent house manners. He is clean, quiet, and very easy to have around. He never harms his trainer's personal belongings. Rico thinks he is a lap dog, curling up with his trainer any opportunity offered.

Outside, in good weather, Rico is more playful, usually for shorter periods of time. Rico's favorite toy is a big rope toy that he plays with interactively with his trainer in the yard. Rico and his best friend Trixie have lived, trained and played together for the past 2+ years.

Rico is approximately 9 years young, a healthy 62 lb hunk of love, neutered, UTD on rabies vaccine and heartworm negative. Rico has many good years in him to love his new person or family.

Rico would love to find someone who prefers a calm, slower pace of life, someone to hang out with, go for walks together and chill on the couch watching TV.

Please go to our FB page for more information, photos and letters from Rico's trainers.

Trixie is a very smart, independent girl who loves to be the center of attention. She gets quite excited when she first meets someone new or when guests come to visit her cell.

With her perpetual happy smile, she approaches each day with joy and anticipation. Trixie shares a dorm with Rico who she adores and teases good naturedly. When he says enough, she is respectful of his desire to be left alone.

Trixie knows sit, down, go to your spot, stay, wait (at doors and for food), leave it, give, off and is crate trained and house trained. She has mastered every mental game we have given her and she is very good at nose work. She can sniff out every morsel that is concealed inside and outside.

Trixie is HIGH energy in her outdoor play and she loves to splash around in water whenever she can find a puddle. Inside, she is well mannered, quiet and never bothers her trainers possessions. In the evenings, she enjoys cuddling with her trainer, getting as close as she can.

Trixie would love an active person or family who enjoys the outdoors, and then a good snuggle on the couch together.

Trixie gets along well with the male dogs in our program with proper introductions. She has been selective with females, so we will be looking for a home either as an only dog or with another friendly male dog.

Nova found herself at a kill shelter at 6 months of age and was adopted by a young family with small children.
She then found herself without a home when this family suffered a house fire that destroyed their home.
She is once again without a home and family as they currently can’t afford the pet deposit in the only home they were able to secure.
She is now around 9 months old and still very much a puppy. She loves to run and play with other dogs. She’d like to play with cats too but they aren’t in agreement. She of course would need supervised around cats and other small animals but she was in a home with a cat and small children. She loves chew toys and squeaky toys they just don’t last her very long before she finds that squeaker and destroys it. She would do great in a home with children or one that is active. She is still learning to walk well in a leash and basic commands. She is crate trained and enjoys her crate for times when she’s left alone."

Meet Baby George!

Save A Pet was contacted by our friends at Mossey Corner Nursery in Forsyth. After hearing a car horn blowing erratically in front of their place of business, our friends ran to the road to see what was going on, and a car had nearly hit and killed two small puppies who had evidently been dumped on the side of the road. They immediately called us for help.
We went and picked up the two puppies that we named Franklin and George. We brought the boys to our shelter after taking them to our local animal control to report them. We kept the boys for their stray hold period and then officially pulled them from the county pound to be part of our Save A Pet family.
George is a very sweet young pup... He loves attention and affection and craves it so. He is very playful and enjoys running around the shelter with his brother Keaton who we picked up the day after we got George and his little brother Franklin.
George and Keaton are our only baby pups at the shelter and we would love for them to leave before they get any bigger. These boys deserve the chance to grow up in a loving home with a family that will teach them everything they need to know.
We believe that George will end up being a medium size dog, possibly around 50 pounds once full grown.

The day after we rescued George and Franklin, we got the call about Keaton. We have no idea how this little puppy managed to survive a night without his siblings in the wooded area in which he was found. There are plenty of known coyote attacks on the local livestock... It is an absolute miracle that this little fella just happened to walk up to the front door of the ladies house early that morning. How he was over a mile away is a mystery. Keaton is one very lucky pup!
Keaton is a mixed breed with what we believe is some bully type breed. He will likely be a medium to large sized dog wants fully grown... maybe weighing around 50 pounds.

Pope is a lover! This dog wants to be your best friend. He is a very good boy. He is working on his recall and comes most of the time when called (he doesn't know his name yet) Pope loves a good lap to sit in and will snuggle with you at night. He is vocal and will tell you when he wants something! He sits very well. He is very friendly with other dogs!
Pope was found by a good Samaritan while running loose on a busy road. Thankfully he wasn't injured. Our local animal control was full so the good Samaritan kept Pope safe and took care of him while he waited out his stray hold. After waiting with no one coming forward to claim him, he was surrendered to Save A Pet.
Since being at the shelter Pope has come out of his shell and is such a happy and friendly boy. He is very playful and loves affection. Snuggle Bug for sure!
Pope is also house trained! He will not go potty in his kennel and will hold it until he gets taken out for a walk every morning. That's quite an accomplishment for a shelter pup!
We are certain that Pope will make and absolutely wonderful addition to just about any home! A fenced yard is needed to keep this energetic boy safe while giving him the freedom and room he needs to be healthy and happy!

Meet Emma!
Emma came to Save A Pet as a stray with 3 sweet nursing puppies. A good samaritan actually witnessed Emma and pups being tossed from a vehicle onto the side of the road and immediately stepped in to save them... (how could anyone be so cruel??!)
After Emma's puppies were weaned and went to a wonderful foster home, they all got adopted! However, Emma still waits for her forever home. Emma is so deserving of love and a happy ever after!
Emma is 6.5 years old and weighs about 60 pounds. She is house trained and has good manners. She tends to get excited when meeting new people, but that's to be expected with some shelter dogs. Emma is one of the most affectionate dogs at Save A Pet and we really want her to find the perfect home!

Update: Emma left the shelter for a trial-adoption and it was discovered that she does not like cats!

Ozark is very skittish. He is a good boy but he needs someone who will show him what it means to be loved. Patience and time are necessary for Ozark to be the good sweet boy that we know he can be!
Ozark loves playing with the other dogs at Save A Pet. He is also pretty well house trained.
Ozark will require a home with a large securely fenced yard, giving him plenty of space to run and ""watch over"" as he shows true Great Pyrenees characteristics in the sense that he likes to guard his area. He is a barker... Always alerting about every little thing.
Ozark will also require another dog to be in the home. He cannot be the only dog. He will need a companion as he has never been without other dogs and would not be happy without one.
Ozark does not like to be put on a leash therefore making it pretty difficult to get him to do anything he does not want to do. We are currently working on this issue.
He is a sweet dog, but he has grown up at the shelter and had not been treated very well before we got him."

Melody arrived with a heavy belly full of musical meatballs. She delivered her pups two days after arrival. Sadly, 2 pups did not make it but we have 7 healthy, happy pups thanks to this beautiful girl. She was a great mama.

Melody also arrived heartworm positive. As soon as she has dried up from nursing her babies and been spayed, she will begin her treatment. She can be adopted while she undergoes treatment and Paws will provide the medications and instructions for her adopter.

Now, on to the good stuff. Melody is such a sweet girl. She is kind of a velcro girl. She loves being with people. She'll climb out of her kennel to get back to you. She keeps a clean space.

This handsome hunk o' love is Big Boi!

Big Boi was found wandering and brought to our building wearing a freyed collar with a broken piece of old rope. The finder then turned him loose before leaving. After he almost got hit by cars on Houston Rd, we brought him in to keep him save while we looked for his family. Ads were put on many local sites and animal control called, but no one came.

This fella quickly won the hearts of many voluteers - even the ones that don't prefer dogs. He has an adorable squishy face and liquid chocolate eyes that make it hard to look away. He's got a stocky build but he's not a huge dog. He's done great with the kids he's met on his walks and at events.

While he did test negative for heartworm, he did test positive for another disease carried by ticks. He's undergoing treatment for that and shouldn't have any effects from it other than the fact that he will test positive for it for the remainder of his life.

Big Boi rides like a dream in the car. He loves belly rubs and will flop right over to get them. He seems to be a ""leaner"", meaning he will sit or stand next to you and lean up against you. He has some basic manners already and knows sit, paw/shake, and walks well on a leash. He's seen cats while out on his walks and hasn't shown interest in them.

Overall, he's a big marshmellow that just wants to be with people and get all the lovin!!

This ol gal has had a rough go. Shyanne is seeking her retirement home life with someone to curl up with and relax.

Shyanne came from animal control. She arrived and tested positive for heartworms. She was scared and super grumpy. She didn't want anyone to touch her, including her foster.

After months of hard work, Shyanne is ready to start looking for that special person to love her furever. She's really come out of her shell.

This sassy little potato is Shyanne. She needs a home with a fenced in yard, as she can't wear a collar and doesn't like her belly touched. Due to her pickiness about being handled, she would prefer a home without young children and a place in the home that's off limits to visiting children. She prefers a female caregiver, but will get used to a man in the home with time. As you can tell, she needs a very special home who will give her the time and patience for her to come around, hence the name SHYanne.

She is very sweet and affectionate on her terms. Gives the best woo woo's and tippy taps when she gets excited. She absolutely loves mealtime and in typical chi fashion she will tell you exactly how she feels! She's talkative, so be prepared for gossip sessions.

Shyanne has a collapsed trachea, so she does cough a bit, but it's easily managed with medicine.

If dogs could talk, Hiccup would have a tail to tell that would run you through all of the emotions.

He had a family that loved him at one point because he was microchipped. He somehow lost his family.

About 6wks ago, a man came to us with this pup wrapped in his jacket. He was severely injured. Matted fur and a wound covered in maggots. After the vet & chip conpany made many, many attempts to contact the owner, it was decided he couldn't wait for surgery any longer. He was shaved down and his front leg was amputated. Which is how he got his new name, Hiccup.

This boy is at least 10-14 yrs old. He is so incredibly sweet. He doesn't care about other dogs or cats. Does well with kids. He's crate trained, but will use a pee pad in his crate as he isn't able to hold it all night . He does have accidents sometimes, but is pretty consistent with pee pads. It's possible previous owners taught him to use those instead of asking to go out.

Hiccup gets around fine at this time. He'll be going to get a professional spa day very soon. We know he is going to 100% enjoy that.

Maximilian finds himself back at the rescue looking for his true furever home. At almost 8 years old, he is coming into his senior years due to being an extra large breed. As in 120lb, extra large size haha.

Max had a family for his first 7 years of his life. When his daddy became ill, he came to Paws. The family that adopted him was not prepared to meet his needs to keep him from getting bored which is why he finds himself looking for pawrents understanding of his breed and needs.

Max is described as a very affectionate, loving velcro dog. His mama was a purebred yellow lab, so he has a beautiful cream coat. His father was a purebred Great Pyranees so his body is pyrenees sized. He is a gorgeous boy overall, but did you look at those eyes?? Stunning!

He's been absolutely loved his entire life. He's a great family dog. Loves children, but thinks cats are gross. He's a giant teddy bear that draws attention anywhere he goes due to his size. He's not met a stranger he didn't like. He currently shares a room (both in seperate kennels) with a pup named Molly with zero issues or concerns

Here are the very few quirks of Max.
- He gets along well with other dogs, so long as food is not involved. He needs to be fed seperate from any other animals in the house.
- Max needs regular exercise or a job to get his energy out. If you are looking for a couch potato - he is not for you. If he doesn't have an outlet, his inner Lab comes out and he will dig.
- Gate latches will need to be secured as he can quickly figure out how to open them.
- He will need owners that will work with him on training. Mainly recall. Great Pyranees are known for requiring owners that are diligent in maintaining training. As a guardian breed, they were bred to think for themselves (how to guard their flock, where all their charges are and how to find/round them up, etc), so they can be stubborn.

Overall, Max is very well behaved. He has quickly become a volunteer favorite. He's fabulous in the car (which needs to be big - he fills the hatch area of a Dodge Journey!). Walks well on a leash. Enjoys being brushed. Happy to stretch out at your feet or on a doggy bed (a big one!!) Max is comprised of two highly intelligent breeds. The possibilities of what he could be taught are endless. As you can see by the pictures, Max loves water. Swimming is a great outlet for energy too.

Ember is a hospice baby. She has a mass in her abdomen. She's heartworm positive. She's currently undergoing treatment. Treatment will be covered by Paws if adopted.","Meet Ember
Ember hasn't had the fairytale life people think dogs have. She's known struggles no animal should know.

This sweet girl was found severely emaciated. She weighed just 29lb. You could see ribs, spine, and hip bones. Even her cheekbones.

With love and lots of groceries, she was on the road to become healthy. However, she also wasn't on preventives so poor Ember also developed Heartworms.

We recently brought Ember in for routine spay, when we got a call from the clinic asking for an immediate call. Paws received the devastating news that this poor girl has a mass. It is firmly attached to her abdominal wall and sits on her aorta. They were unable to even biopsy it due to its location.

Due to this, Ember is being placed as a hospice. We don't know how long she has. It could be months or years. What we do know, is we are praying someone will want to take her home, spoil her, and love her to the other side of the rainbow bridge.

Ember is a sweet ol gal. She enjoys a comfy blanket or raised bed. Sometimes she will put all her stuffies on the bed and sleep on the floor.

Of course she loves snacks. Cookies is her favorite word haha.

Ember loves car rides. She's an excellent backseat driver! She's a very laid back girl, so she doesn't bounce around in the car.

She has the most expressive face. Which makes it even funnier when she's telling you exactly what she thinks or wants. Because Ember can be a bit insistent when she sets her mind to something.

Ember would love a big comfy couch to curl up on and watch TV with her people. A big bed to sprawl out on while she waits for her person to come home.

We are recommending Ember be placed as an only pet in the home.

This smart girl knows what she wants and she wants you to click the ADOPT or FOSTER button and put an application in."

Once upon a time, there was a handsome pup named Hardy. Hardy liked to go on adventures. One day, he ventured so far he got lost. Someone saw him wandering alone and called the dog catcher!

Hardy found himself in puppy jail. He had mug shots and everything! And they posted those mug shots for all to see (so embarrassing). BUT, someone saw his picture and thought he deserved a second chance. So he was sprung from jail and he came to Paws in Middle Georgia rescue. Hardy got some shots (yuk!) AND this thing called a microchip. Paws told him it was so he would never be lost again.

Unfortunately, Hardy found himself back at Paws after being returned due to lifestyle changes. He's hoping someone will see how big and handsome he's grown and want to give him his furever home.

Hardy wants to go on more adventures. There's a whole big world out there! But this time, he's hoping to find a human that loves adventures as much as he does. Someone to take him camping, hiking, swimming, boating, to the dog park, and hopefully lots of long walks or even some jogging to help him burn off his high energy.

With his adorable nacho chip ears, Hardy is sure to be popular. Everyone will want to be seen with this handsome young man at their side.

Send in your application to make Hardy your partner in crime... I mean in adventures. Cuz this pup has sworn to live the straight and narrow in his furever home."

**To help him find his best life - one of our supporters has done a partial sponsorship of his adoption fee! His fee is now only $150 to the adopter.**

This handsome fella is TJ.

TJ came to us from animal control with an old injury to his leg. When he went to see the vet, it was found the head of his femur had been severed at some point. He received FHO surgery and his physical therapy has gone fantastic. He is moving around really well and one would hardly know he was injured.

If your looking for a family dog you can't get one better than TJ! He is a loving cuddle bug. Would be happy laying on the couch all day with you! He is very low maintenance. Feed him and let him sit with you and he's a happy boy!

If you do have another dog, TJ will love him! He loves tag with other dogs. Is great at tug! And is learning fetch (he brings it back 85% of the time). He knows how to sit and lay down. Loves his crate! We have not trained a recall but he comes running when we call (he's easily trained).
He is a bit mouthy when playing, And he takes corrections from us and other dogs like a champ!

He does limp still but it is out of habit not pain. He will use all his legs just fine when running playing and jumping. But after a nap he may favor his strong leg (we haven't seen any sign of pain)

This handsome boy could he part of your family. Applications are being reviewed to find the home that can provide his best life. Get yours in today!"

This beautiful girl has sadly been waiting for her family over 500 days (July 2023).

Affectionately called Oatmeal (after the Little Debbies Oatmeal Creme Pies), the animal control officer used his snacks to catch her.

As you can see in some of her pictures, this girl has known pain and hardship for much of her young life. She suffered some type of burns all along her spine - either chemical or from crawling under a vehicle with a hot muffler. The burns have healed, but the scars are there as witness to her suffering. She has vision issues. Oatmeal was never spayed and found herself pregnant. On top of everything, Oatmeal tested positive for heartworms. She's since completed treatment and is now heartworm negative! Yayyy!

Oatmeal will need a patient home. After some behavior changes, Oatmeal went to see the vet. On 29 May, the vet stated her vision is gone. She likely can see shadows and movement, but not well enough to distinguish strange objects. She is doing extremely well in her foster home though. Her adopter will need to keep the vision issues in mind when bringing her into new surroundings.

Mama Oatmeal is looking for a special home with people who will love, spoil, and pamper this precious girl. She would love a nice cozy bed (yours or her very own). She enjoys spending time with people, car rides, and going outside to enjoy the day. She loves her puppy foster brother. Oatmeal would make an excellent road dog to someone that drives semi's so long as you can lift her into the truck. Her ideal home would be a 1 story and possibly the use of a portable ramp to help her gain confidence in getting up/down. If there are other animals living in the home, a meet and greet will be essential.

***Oatmeal's adoption fee has been covered by her previous foster and a Paws supporter. This means qualified & approved adopters will not pay an adoption fee.***

Introducing Wanda, affectionately known as ""The Walmart Dog""—and she’s ready to upgrade from aisle five to her forever home! Wanda’s journey to becoming a social media sensation started back in July 2024, when she decided to take herself on an epic summer vacation, roaming the streets like a furry free spirit. She traveled far and wide, covering more ground than most people do on their morning jog. But unlike a regular tourist, Wanda didn’t just sightsee—oh no. She starred in her own wildlife documentary!

This clever girl found every camera set up to catch her and decided they made perfect chew toys. She didn’t just pose for the cameras; she took them down like a pro, probably thinking, “I’m the star of this show, and I’m keeping the footage.” Facebook soon lit up with Wanda’s antics—she was basically a celebrity, living rent-free in everyone’s hearts (and the woods).

But like all great stories, Wanda’s roaming days came to an end on September 10, 2024, when her Foster Angel swooped in. This hero finally trapped our sneaky superstar and brought her into a loving foster home. Now Wanda’s days are filled with cuddles, belly rubs, and, thankfully, no more camera sabotage. She’s traded her wild days for cozy nights, and she’s loving every minute of it!

Wanda is ready for the next chapter of her life. She’s got the charm, the smarts, and a little bit of mischief left in her—all she needs now is you!

**Bear's Big Adventure: Finding a Forever Home**

Once upon a time in a bustling shelter, a spirited Jack Russell Terrier named Bear found himself at a crossroads. After years of being the dynamic half of a duo alongside his brother Benji, it was time for Bear to step out and shine on his own. Sure, he and Benji were known for their wild antics, but now it was Bear’s chance to find his forever home without his little sidekick around.

With a flip of his fluffy tail, Bear strutted through the shelter’s play area, ready to take on the world. “Time to show everyone what Bear is all about!” he barked, puffing out his chest. He was a bundle of energy, the embodiment of fun—like a whirlwind wrapped in fur. While Benji had been the sweet, well-mannered one, Bear was all about excitement, mischief, and maybe a little chaos.

As Bear prepared for his big debut, he remembered all the fun times he’d had with Benji. They’d unrolled entire toilet paper rolls, staged epic tug-of-war battles, and turned the shelter into their own little playground. But now, it was time for Bear to find a family who appreciated his zest for life.

“Okay, Bear,” he muttered to himself, “time to impress some humans!” He dashed to the front of his kennel, showing off his signature “I’m totally adorable” pose—head cocked, tongue lolling, and those big, beautiful eyes sparkling with mischief.

So, with his tail wagging and heart racing, Bear is ready to strut his stuff for potential adopters.

Disposition: True to the Jack Russell temperament

Her journey is not just a testament to her strength but also to the dedication of those who have cared for her in her foster home.

Heartworm disease is a serious condition that can lead to severe health problems for dogs, but Lola's successful recovery is a beacon of light for all pets battling this illness. It's a reminder of the importance of regular veterinary care and the miracles that can happen with love and medical attention.

Now, Lola is blossoming, her personality shining through as she learns to navigate the world with newfound health. She's becoming a well-mannered, happy girl, though her compatibility with children is still being assessed. For the time being, a home without small children is sought, ensuring Lola's transition is as smooth as possible.

The search for Lola's forever home is filled with anticipation. The ideal family will understand her needs, provide her with the love she deserves, and continue to support her on her journey to becoming the best companion she can be.

For those interested in welcoming Lola into their lives, a meet and greet is a wonderful opportunity to connect and see if your home could be the perfect match for this sweet soul.

Meet Andi, the sweet and spirited Terrier mix who's ready to celebrate her first birthday on May 25, 2024, in a loving forever home! This gorgeous girl has been with us since she was just a tiny pup of three weeks old and has grown into a 40-pound bundle of love with room to fill out her lanky frame.

Andi is the calmer half of the sibling duo, with a beautiful brown coat and a heart full of eagerness to please. She's a social butterfly who adores people, gets along great with other dogs and children, and even did well with cats during her early foster days. Andi loves to carry her bedding or a toy around like she's proudly showing off her baby, adding an extra dose of cuteness to her charming personality.

This leash-walking pro is always up for playtime when you come to get her from outside. In the big yard, she and her brother Amos, who is also looking for a forever home, love to expend their energy playing. While Amos might be the rowdier one, Andi is not shy about putting him in his place when needed. They both have the most adorable matching circles on top of their heads, making them a unique pair.

Last September, Andi and Amos bravely battled parvo and emerged victorious, thanks to an experimental treatment that had them on the mend in just 48 hours. They've spent their first year with us, filling our days with joy, but now they’re ready to bring that same happiness to their new families.

Andi might need a bit of training for basic manners, but her loving nature and playful spirit make her an excellent addition to any family. Adopt Andi today, and get ready for a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless tail wags!"

Meet Amos, the birthday boy with boundless energy and a heart full of love! This handsome Terrier mix is turning one on May 25, 2024, and he's on the hunt for his forever home. Amos has been with us since he was just a wee pup of three weeks old, and he's grown into a lanky 40-pound bundle of joy with room to fill out even more.

Amos is the life of the party, always ready to play and shower you with attention. He’s a social butterfly who loves people, gets along swimmingly with other dogs and kids, and even has a good track record with cats from his early days in foster care. His sleek grey coat and spirited personality set him apart, making him the spicier half of the sibling duo with his sister Andi, who is also available for adoption.

Life with Amos is never dull. He’s a pro on the leash and loves wrapping himself around your waist for a play session when you take his slip lead off. In the big yard, he and Andi burn off their energy, with Andi sometimes reminding Amos who’s boss. They both sport the cutest matching circle on top of their heads, a unique feature that adds to their charm.

Despite their rough patch last September when they both bravely battled and beat parvo, Amos and Andi have bounced back stronger than ever, thanks to an experimental treatment that had them on the mend in just 48 hours. These resilient pups have spent their first year with us, filling our days with joy and laughter, but now they’re ready to bring that same happiness to their new families.

Amos might need a bit of training for basic manners, but his playful spirit and loving nature will make him an excellent addition to any family. Adopt Amos today, and get ready for endless adventures and unconditional love!"

Meet our Cowboy!
This big fella is one fine pup! He is super friendly with dogs and with people too. He was picked up as a stray by the local animal control. Someone has to be missing this sweet boy. It is clear that he has a foundation of house-training as he doesn't make a mess in his kennel. Cowboy is currently working on his leash skills and is catching on quickly. He is a big and strong pup. He is said to have been born sometime in June of 2019 and he weighs 70 pounds.
Cowboy would do best in a home with older children due to his higher energy level and large size. Secure fence required.
Please contact the Save A Pet shelter at 478-994-3882 or send a message through Petfinder.
UPDATE to add: Cowboy went on an extended trial-adoption with a family that adores him but just doesn't have the space/yard that he needs. He is super active and needs to be able to run. Here is what they say about Cowboy: He is sweet, not much of a cuddler but he will if you let him on the couch or bed with you. He is very smart, loves learning. This dog is extremely active, he can run and swim for hours. He's picky about the dogs he likes and doesn't, same with people.
He's mostly chases cats, but we've been working with him and he's getting better. I think he really just wants to play."

Sex: Male
Weight: Approx. 65 lbs
Good with Dogs: Yes, although no small dogs, Diesel prefers laidback females his size.
Good with Cats: No
Good with Kids: Older kids
Heartworm Status: Negative

Diesel is a great boy that has had a hard past and has persevered through it all. Diesel originally came to us after our staff arrived for work one morning and found Diesel tied to our gate. Without a note, and no information on his past, all that we know about Diesel’s past is that he was absolutely heartbroken when he arrived, and missed his people very, very much. After undergoing heartworm treatment and having to learn how to handle being crated, Diesel has waited for his forever family and is ready to go home.

Diesel walks great on a leash. He is very smart and likes to go shopping. He really loves sunbathing, and being outside. He has a thing for toys and likes to chase squeaky toys and tennis balls especially. He is housebroken and rides great in a car.

Diesel is not a fan of small creatures likes cats or small animals and will give chase. Diesel prefers laidback, non-dominant females. While he isn’t really the kind of dog that would do well at a dog park, Diesel is the kind of boy that knows what it’s like to have people love him and just wants a chance to have a forever family that won’t abandon him for reasons he can’t understand.

Name: Weebles

Breed: Vizsla Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/estimate 10 months old/50lbs at the moment but still growing

Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and on preventatives

House trained/Crate Trained: No training yet, but I have had to stay in a big crate since I was found because of my medical needs. I do pretty good at not going to the bathroom inside of the cage, with a few little accidents.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Has not been tested with cats or children, but can be tested upon request. Weebles has had very controlled interactions with other dogs mostly because of his injuries, so I don't want to mess up his current PT progress. He seems very interested in playing with other dogs though.

Energy Level: Very high- I am a super-active dog who needs a high-energy owner

Before FAR/My History: I was found 5/25/2024 on the side of a road next to an orchard lying beside a laundry basket with a tarp. My humans don't know if someone dumped me but it looks that way. I had been hit by a car some months earlier and my legs didn't work right. I was very skinny and hungry. I had femoral head and neck ostectomy (FHO surgery) on 6/20/2024 on my back right leg to fix all the problems caused by the accident and the subsequent medical neglect. I am in rehab right now for my hip. Things are going well, but on 8/11/2024 I re-broke my elbow. Apparently I had broken it in the original incident but it had healed over before I was found and had surgery. With this minor setback, I will have to stay on cage rest for a bit longer while my leg and elbow recover, but I am looking forward to running injury-free soon.

Training Status/Commands I know: Sit and Touch the open hand to get a treat/food instead of leaping for the food

Working on: Everything- I am trying to learn a lot while I do rehab, but some exercises will have to wait until after treatment. I have puppy energy, but I am working on channeling it into being a good dog.

Things I like: Playtime! Any interaction is playtime to me. I am always ready to run and explore which I can't do much of because of my leg, but once I am healed - lookout! I definitely still have puppy energy, but I am an active breed. I love chew toys and treats and if I can sit still long enough, I love belly scratches.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out. It is hard to watch the other dogs run when you're on the injured list, but I really like going on walks with others. If you are doing something, I want to be right there doing it with you. I need constant interaction and stimulation so that I don't get bored.

Things that make my humans happy: My happiness even though I've been through so much. I go to my doctor appointments with the same attitude that I go to get a pup cup, just happy to see everyone and everything. My name is Weebles because I wobble but I don't fall down, physically or figuratively. I am always a happy pup.

Ideal Family/Home: Right now I am still a mystery. I haven't gotten to play with other dogs or people other than my humans because of my surgery restrictions, but soon I will start interacting with the other fosters and we will see my true personality shine.

Name: Oscar

Breed: Blackmouth Cur Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/ estimate 2 years old/ around 50 lbs and I am full grown

Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and on preventatives

House trained/Crate Trained: In progress

Dogs/Cats/Children: Oscar has not been tested with cats or children yet, but can be tested upon request. Oscar has had very controlled interactions with other dogs and seems to enjoy other high energy breeds

Energy Level: High- I am a very athletic dog who loves to run and play

Before FAR/My History: I wandered up to somebody's house on 3/11/2024. I had been spotted the week before getting into the neighbors' trash at night because I was a hungry pup. I couldn't stay there because of their older dog who is very sick, but they put me in this program and I get to stay and play with 3 other foster dogs.

Training Status/Commands I know: Sit and touch the open hand to get a treat/food instead of leaping for the food

Working on: Everything

Things I like: Playtime, especially with another dog who is as energetic as I am. My running buddy is another FAR foster Sheila aka Havoc. I like to chase her when she has a toy, and I also like to be chased when I have a toy.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out, especially if another dog runs by and I see them playing.

Things that make my humans happy: My endless energy. I am always down to play, run, fetch, etc. And when it is time to rest, I like to snuggle and get chest scratches.

Ideal Family/Home: Because of my energy and drive, I think I would like a home without cats or small dogs. I love playing with Sheila aka Havoc because she is my size and matches my energy, so I think a mid-size, young female dog would be a perfect playmate for me.

Things I like: Playtime, especially with another dog who is as energetic as I am. My running buddy is another FAR foster Sheila aka Havoc. I like to chase her when she has a toy, and I also like to be chased when I have a toy.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out, especially if another dog runs by and I see them playing.

Things that make my humans happy: My endless energy. I am always down to play, run, fetch, etc. And when it is time to rest, I like to snuggle and get chest scratches.

Ideal Family/Home: Because of my energy and drive, I think I would like a home without cats or small dogs. I love playing with Sheila aka Havoc because she is my size and matches my energy, so I think a mid-size, young female dog would be a perfect playmate for me.

73995696,Weebles,Vizsla,Mixed Breed,True,Young,Male,Medium,,,,Furever After Rescue,GA793,31210,6,,,,,False,"Macon, GA",N/A,N/A,Spayed / neutered.,"Meet Weebles
Name: Weebles

Breed: Vizsla Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/estimate 10 months old/50lbs at the moment but still growing

Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative and on preventatives

House trained/Crate Trained: No training yet, but I have had to stay in a big crate since I was found because of my medical needs. I do pretty good at not going to the bathroom inside of the cage, with a few little accidents.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Has not been tested with cats or children, but can be tested upon request. Weebles has had very controlled interactions with other dogs mostly because of his injuries, so I don't want to mess up his current PT progress. He seems very interested in playing with other dogs though.

Energy Level: Very high- I am a super-active dog who needs a high-energy owner

Before FAR/My History: I was found 5/25/2024 on the side of a road next to an orchard lying beside a laundry basket with a tarp. My humans don't know if someone dumped me but it looks that way. I had been hit by a car some months earlier and my legs didn't work right. I was very skinny and hungry. I had femoral head and neck ostectomy (FHO surgery) on 6/20/2024 on my back right leg to fix all the problems caused by the accident and the subsequent medical neglect. I am in rehab right now for my hip. Things are going well, but on 8/11/2024 I re-broke my elbow. Apparently I had broken it in the original incident but it had healed over before I was found and had surgery. With this minor setback, I will have to stay on cage rest for a bit longer while my leg and elbow recover, but I am looking forward to running injury-free soon.

Training Status/Commands I know: Sit and Touch the open hand to get a treat/food instead of leaping for the food

Working on: Everything- I am trying to learn a lot while I do rehab, but some exercises will have to wait until after treatment. I have puppy energy, but I am working on channeling it into being a good dog.

Things I like: Playtime! Any interaction is playtime to me. I am always ready to run and explore which I can't do much of because of my leg, but once I am healed - lookout! I definitely still have puppy energy, but I am an active breed. I love chew toys and treats and if I can sit still long enough, I love belly scratches.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out. It is hard to watch the other dogs run when you're on the injured list, but I really like going on walks with others. If you are doing something, I want to be right there doing it with you. I need constant interaction and stimulation so that I don't get bored.

Things that make my humans happy: My happiness even though I've been through so much. I go to my doctor appointments with the same attitude that I go to get a pup cup, just happy to see everyone and everything. My name is Weebles because I wobble but I don't fall down, physically or figuratively. I am always a happy pup.

Ideal Family/Home: Right now I am still a mystery. I haven't gotten to play with other dogs or people other than my humans because of my surgery restrictions, but soon I will start interacting with the other fosters and we will see my true personality shine.

Vetting: Up to date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, and on preventatives

House trained/Crate Trained: In progress

Dogs/Cats/Children: Loves other dogs and people. Hasn't had extended interactions with children, but he loves to play with anybody. He hasn't been unsupervised around cats-he only gets to play with them when being watched.

Energy Level: Medium-high, but a lot of his energy is because he is such a young puppy.

Before FAR/My History: I was found on 10/13/24 hiding between two trashcans. Somebody dumped me nearby and I made my way to these trashcans before someone found me. I was a little skinny and flea-bitten, but after a week or so with my foster, I am chunky and my coat is extra soft and shiny.

Training Status/Commands I know: Sort of knows ""Sit""

Working on: Everything, because I am a puppy after all!

Things I like: Playtime with other dogs. I get to play with Weebles, Binx, and my foster's personal dogs - two pits and two chihuahua mixes. I like playing with the cats but they don't always like playing with me, probably because I am a clumsy puppy.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out. I need a companion all the time.

Things that make my humans happy: My joyful personality and my little pittie waddle. It shows how happy I am all the time even though I was discarded by my previous owner.

Ideal Family/Home: A home with another dog would be great, I'd love to have a playmate. Since I am so young, I think just about any situation would be great for me as long as I have someone to teach me what to do. I crave other dogs' attention.

Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, and on preventatives

House trained/Crate Trained: Doing well with house and crate training.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Loves other dogs and people. Hasn't had extended interactions with children, but he loves to play with anybody. He hasn't been unsupervised around cats-he only gets to play with them while being watched. He doesn't chase them. He doesn't understand why they don't want to play ball with him, so he usually ends up getting swatted.

Energy Level: Medium-high, but a lot of his energy is because he is a puppy. He does like to crash and snuggle when playtime is over.

Before FAR/My History: Somebody found me running in a sod field on 9/22/24. They dropped me off with my current foster because their dog did not get along with me. I got picked up right before Hurricane Helene tore through the state. I'm too young/small to hang out with the big FAR foster dogs, so I get to bunk in the cat shed with a FAR pup on the injured list (Weebles), a FAR foster fail (Wraith), and 6 cats.

Training Status/Commands I know: Sort of knows ""Sit"".

Working on: Everything, because I am a puppy after all!

Things I like: Playtime with other dogs. I get to play with Weebles and Jasper (a younger FAR pup), and my foster's personal dogs - two pits and two chihuahua mixes. I love playing with humans, especially if you have a ball to throw. Ear scratches and belly rubs are my favorite. Basically I like any sort of attention.

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out. I need a companion all the time.

Things that make my humans happy: My sweet personality. I love everything and get super excited about everything and everyone.

Ideal Family/Home: A home with another dog would be great, I'd love to have a playmate. Since I am still a puppy and love to learn, I think just about any situation would be great for me as long as I have someone to teach me what to do.

Breed: German Shepherd

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/estimated 2 years old/62lbs at the moment, but I am severely underweight

Vetting: Up-to-date on all vaccines, neutered, microchipped, and receiving treatment for heartworms.

House trained/Crate Trained: In progress.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Has not been observed around dogs, cats, or children, but can be tested upon request.

Energy Level: High-I am a super-active dog who needs a high-energy owner.

Before FAR/My History: I was found 8/7/2024 running on the road in a rural area next to some cotton fields. I was very skinny, flea-bitten, and thirsty, but I love to ride in a car so I hopped right in when a human pulled up. The vet says I need to gain some weight, but overall I am very healthy. I am in treatment for heartworms right now, but as soon as I am done with that I will be ready to play. No microchip or owner was found, and someone suggested I was dumped because I wasn't a mean, protective German Shepherd aka a failure. I am a sweet boy and would love to be part of someone's family.

Training Status/Commands I know: So far I know sit.

Working on: Everything. I am trying to learn a lot while I treat my heartworms, but some exercises will have to wait until after treatment. I have so much energy, but I am working on channeling it into being a good dog.

Things I like: Food! I was 25 lbs underweight when I was found, so I really enjoy any food/treats I am given. I am always ready to run and explore in search of food. Maybe after I gain weight I will be interested in other things, but right now I just want to find the food. I am an active breed and need stimulation. I love games where I get to find things like hidden treats. If you like to go-go-go, I am the perfect dog for you!

Things I don't like: I haven't been out and about enough for my humans to know what I don't like. Right now, I don't like waiting on my dinner, but I will sit for it like a good boy.

Things that make my humans happy: My excitement for everything and my attitude. The humans don't know where I came from or what I experienced but I am sweet nonetheless and am very happy in my new life.

Ideal Family/Home: Right now I am still a mystery. I haven't gotten to play with other dogs or people other than my humans, but soon I will start interacting with the other fosters and going places with my human to see who my perfect family could be.

House trained/Crate trained: Yes/Yes

Dogs/Kids/Cats- Yes/Yes/I have not been observed around cats yet but can be tested upon request.

Energy Level: I love to play and I also love to give all the lovin and snuggles. I'm the best of both worlds! My foster Mama calls me a sweet silly girl because I'm as sweet as I am playful. My favorite thing to do is play with my foster fur siblings. If I'm not doing that, I love finding a toy or stick and playing with it or chewing on it (I am a puppy after all!). I also LOVE to play in the water and explore. When I'm not playing or exploring I'm perfectly content to relax for a bit or take a nap by my hoomans or in my crate.

Before FAR/My History: My foster Mama found me and my brother abandoned near a dumpster. My brother found the perfect furever home, and now it's my turn to find mine!

Training Status/Commands I know: sit, stay, shake and release.

Things I like: playing (with hoomans and dogs!), anything related to the WATER! Hose, sprinkler, pool, it doesn't matter. Nothing makes me happier than splashing around in the water! I've also been on several hikes and loved exploring with my foster mama. So many things to see and smell! Treats and food are my favorite too! Pretty much any toy I enjoy playing with as well as running around outside, exploring, giving the best lovin and snuggles and being pet and loved on by hoomans.

Ideal Family/Home: I would do great with a family that could give me lots of affection and will love and play with me. I'd also do great with another fur sibling that does not mind me being a puppy and even better, will play with me!

Things I don't like: It appears bigger dogs can be intimidating and she's shy around some men.

Vetting: Neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and on heartworm, flea, and tick prevention

House trained/Crate Trained: Latte is doing great on crate training and house training.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Latte hasn't been exposed to cats or children yet. But he's great with other dogs and people.

Energy Level: Medium - He loves running and playing, inside and out. But he's also a snuggle bug who loves spending time with his people or even better, in their laps.

Training Status/Commands I know: He's good with come and sit (especially with the enticement of a treat).

Things I don't like: Not much! Perhaps just a typical puppy fear of sudden, loud noises.

Things that make my humans happy: Latte is so darn cute! And he loves sharing kisses and cuddling with his people.

Ideal Family/Home: Latte will do best in a furever home without young children or submissive dogs. He will need an adopter who is committed to training him and working with him on a daily basis.

Vetting: Up to date on vaccines, spayed, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Please see the special notes regarding Roxy's cancer diagnosis.

House-trained/Crate-trained: I am fully house-trained and crate-trained, although my foster parents leave me out of the crate when they are not around. I spend most of my time sleeping anyways.

Dogs/Cats/Children: I would prefer to be the only dog in the home. I also don't like cats very much. I have never been around children inside a home but I have met a couple on walks and I seem to like them.

Energy Level: Low energy but I enjoy going on short walks.

Before FAR/My History: Before coming to FAR, I was surrendered due to a cancerous mass. Since then, I have undergone three surgeries to remove the masses. The vet mentioned that there is still a possibility that the cancer may have spread to other parts of my body. There is also a possibility that the cancerous masses that were removed will come back. The type of cancer I have is an aggressive form of doggy breast cancer. However, I have been doing well and have been gaining weight under the care of my foster parents.

Things I like: Cuddles, treats, and getting love.

Things I don't like: Loud noises.

Ideal Family/Home: I am a senior dog with special needs, but I am still a loving and sweet companion. I am hoping to find a peaceful and comfortable place to spend my golden years.

Name: Midnight

Breed: Pit Bull Terrier/Labrador Retriever Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Female/5 years/38 lbs

Vetting: Spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations, and heartworm negative

House trained/Crate Trained: Yes/Yes

Before FAR: I was an owner surrender that was rescued from the Macon-Bibb animal shelter along with my 7 babies, whom I took great care of. They have all found their furever homes, and now it's my turn!

Energy Level: I am very active and love to run and play. I would do well in a home with another playful dog or an active family that wants to spend time with me to train me or wear out my energy with fun hikes, runs, or walks.

Training status: I am very well trained. I know ""sit"", ""down"", ""place"", ""break"" (release command), and ""here"" (recall command). I walk great on leash. My foster can show you all my training for you to continue to reinforce my good habits.

Things that make me happy: I love running in the yard and playing with the other dogs in my foster home, but most of all I LOVE people! I love to interact with and be with my humans. I genuinely enjoy training and feel more fulfilled when I am worked with on a regular basis.

Things that make my humans happy: I am the sweetest little girl. I love to snuggle up on the couch with you. I go willingly into my crate when it is time for my humans to be away or when it is time to go to bed.

Working on: Excitement around new people (jumping up or trying to get in a lap unwelcomed), but it is only because I am so eager to meet and love on new humans!

Dogs: Love the other dogs in my foster home and I am friendly with all dogs I meet! I have great social skills with other dogs, but a meet and greet with future siblings would be best to make sure they can handle my energy.

Cats: Midnight is non-reactive to cats indoors with a very slow introduction, but tends to chase cats that are outdoors.

Ideal Family/Home: A family that will make me part of their pack and take me on adventures. I would likely do best in a home with a fenced in yard or someone who can give me adequate exercise, as I love to run and play. I would love a doggy playmate or maybe some kids to play with? I'm not too picky as long as you want me to be with you always!

Special Notes: Every now and then I pick up my back leg when I am running. This is from an old injury that healed prior to coming to the rescue, but it doesn't seem to slow me down or bother me one bit!

Name: Queen

Breed: American Staffordshire Terrier

Sex/Age/Weight: Female/2 years (estimate)/60 lbs

Vetting: Spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccines and preventatives.

House Trained/Crate Trained/Leash Trained: Yes to all three

Energy Level: Medium. Queen loves to be outside, running and playing, in all temperatures. But she equally loves to be inside, cuddling with her people on the couch or in bed.

Before FAR: Queen was a neighborhood stray before she moved to a foster home. She gave birth to ten happy, healthy babies, all of whom have already been adopted. And now it's Queen's turn!

Things she likes: running and playing with canine friends, going on walks, Nylabones or Benebones, plush toys to destroy, squeaky and crinkly toys, treats (lots of treats!), nice places to nap (a human's lap, doggy beds, couches, beds), ideally by the side of her human(s). And of course she loves to give and receive hugs. It seems like Queen's goal in life is to make up on all the loving she missed during her life as a stray.

What she really likes: Queen loves everybody, but she especially loves children!

Things she doesn't like: Queen is a very happy girl - there isn't much of anything she doesn't like. Other than loud noises, such as gun shots.

Ideal Family/Home: Queen would fit good in almost any home - with or without other dogs, with or without children. She is a ""happy-go-lucky"" dog who is happiest being where her family is - whether that's inside or out in the yard. Her sweet nature shines through in every action, making her the perfect companion for those seeking a furry friend to share life's joys.

Name: Grace

Breed: Labrador Retriever/Pit Bull Terrier Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Female/1yr/45lbs

Vetting: All vetting is complete- She is spayed, microchipped, current on vaccinations and Proheart 12, with a negative HW test.

House trained/Crate Trained: Grace is house trained and crate trained. She can escape from a regular wire crate, so she will need an indestructible crate.

Dogs/Cats/Children: She is great with children of all sizes and activity. She is also great with other dogs. We are working through her urge to chase cats, but she may be more suitable in a home without them.

Energy Level: She is medium to high energy due to being a puppy.

Before FAR/My History: Grace was brought to the vet as a hit by car. She was unable to use her back legs and had a major laceration on her side. We knew she was a survivor when she would lick and love on us even though she was in a massive amount of pain. After being treated, Grace has no signs of the laceration, but still has a very slight limp on her rear leg. This should go away with time, and most of the time you don't even notice it! It doesn't slow this girl down!

Training Status/Commands I know: Grace is learning sit, stay, and place. She walks great on a leash.

Things I like: Grace loves to be the center of attention and will do anything to keep it! She loves playing with other people, dogs, and children. She loves being in the same room with a human, best of all!

Things I don't like: She does not like being left alone at this time. I think with training, she will come accustomed to a schedule and knowing her human will return. She gets very attached very quickly and is looking for someone to love!!!

Things that make my humans happy: Grace has a very sweet demeanor and is very affectionate towards humans and her canine siblings.

Ideal Family/Home: Grace would do best in a home with a fenced in yard. She would fit in well in a small or large family. She just has a lot of love to give!

House trained/Crate Trained: Yes to both!

Dogs/Cats/Children: She is great around kids and loves other dogs! She would do best in a home with no cats or small dogs because she can be a little silly and play a bit rough.

Energy Level: Low to medium

Before FAR/My History: Hilly aka Opal was pulled from Bibb County Animal Shelter. She was on the euthanasia list, and we thought she was too sweet and goofy to let her go. Since then, she has blossomed and has quite the big personality. She's silly and loves to make you laugh! She's very sweet and loving.

Training Status/Commands I know: Hilly aka Opal knows sit, down, place and her name. She is trained to walk in a heel position while on structured walks, and is also e collar trained.

Things I like: Going on walks, belly rubs, blankets, sunbathing, and playing with other dogs.

Ideal Family/Home: A home where she has a yard to play in. She would be happy either as an only dog or with another sweet dog. She would love humans who are active and want to keep up with all her training. She is a great hiking buddy and loves to go for walks, but also would love a comfy couch to lay on.

Breed: Hound/Pitbull Terrier Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Female/3 years old/56lbs

Vetting: Up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped.

House trained/Crate Trained: In progress.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Havoc gets along well with other dogs and cats. She has not been observed around children. I can be dog, cat, and kid tested upon request.

Energy Level: Very high! I am a super-active dog who needs a high-energy owner.

Before FAR/My History: I was wandering through the woods for a while before finding a nice doorstep to curl up on at the beginning of June 2023. The owner of the doorstep was too old to keep me, so I ended up at FAR. I was a little skinny and had some skin issues at first, but they are gone now. I have filled out and am a compact, muscular dynamo!

Training Status/Commands I know: Sit

Working on: Everything, and I am in training right now! I have so much energy, but I am working on channeling it into being a good dog!

Things I like: Playtime! Any interaction is playtime to me. I am always ready to run and explore. I never seem to tire out. I definitely still have puppy energy, but I am an active breed. I will likely have a high amount of energy even when I get older due to my breed. If you are a runner or a hiker, I am the perfect dog for you!

Things I don't like: I don't like to be left out. If you are doing something, I want to be right there doing it with you. I need constant interaction and stimulation so that I don't get bored.

Things that make my humans happy: My happy-go-lucky attitude. I am down for anything as long as I'm with a human and/or another dog.

Ideal Family/Home: Right now I bunk beside another FAR pup ""Wraith,"", and I go on walks and car rides with her daily. I also run with two Chihuahua mixes, a Pitbull, and I visit 4 indoor cats daily. I do well with all of them, but sometimes my hyperactivity aggravates them. I am just so excited to play with them, but they don't always want to play with me. I would like a home with athletic and outdoorsy people and dogs. Due to a high prey drive, I would not do well with small animals, but I pair well with medium or large size animals. I am an outside dog at the moment, but I am working on chilling inside.

Name: Iris

Breed: Labrador Retriever / Dogo Argentino mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Female, DOB 04/12/23, approximately 55 lbs

Vetting: Spayed, UTD on vaccines, on monthly heartworm, flea & tick preventative, and microchipped.

Crate / house trained: Doing great! She is used to being crated overnight. Being a typical young pup, she needs frequent potty breaks to avoid having accidents in the house.

Energy Level: Typical active puppy!

Training Status / Commands: Working on not jumping up on people and recalls.

Things she likes: She LOVES other dogs. She plays non-stop with another puppy in her foster home, and gets along great with all of the other dogs in her foster home.

Things she doesn't like: Staying in her crate when her foster mom is working during the day. She's still so little and gets bored.

Before FAR / My history: Iris and her family were turned in to a shelter when they were less than a week old, and they moved to a foster home a couple of weeks later.

Ideal Family Home: Iris would love to be in a home with other dogs to play with.

Special Notes: Iris's foster mom says she is SO smart! She does something every day to demonstrate how smart she is.

Iris is still just a baby who will need an adopter who will commit the time to continue to train her, teach her manners, and burn off her considerable energy with play. Our rescue also requires that all adopter's current pets are up-to-date on vaccinations (DHLPP & Rabies) and preventatives (heartworm and flea and tick), unless there is a medical reason not allowing it. All animals in your household should be spayed or neutered unless medically indicated that they should not be or are currently still too young.

Name: Dot aka Koda Nicknames - Koda Nick or Koda Bear

Breed: Australian Cattle Dog/Blue Heeler/Chow Chow

Sex/Age/Weight: Female/3 years old/55 lbs.

Vetting: Spayed, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on prevention, dewormed, flea/tick/parasite-free, and microchipped

House/Crate Trained: Yes/Yes. Koda loves her crate! When it comes to nap time or settling in for the evening Koda goes right in for a snooze.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Yes/No/Yes. Koda does very well with medium to large sized dogs and has two furry siblings she loves to wrestle with. She is not comfortable with smaller dogs and cats so it is best that she be the one and only or have a medium to large size dog to hang out with. She loves children of all ages especially when she can cuddle up with them and get belly rubs.

Training: Koda is working on her commands and manners. She knows sit, down, and paw, and walks great on a leash. She will need someone to continue to train her so she can be the best girl for you!

Working on: Koda is quite the snuggle bunny and sometimes thinks she is a lap dog. She is learning that you can cuddle with your humans without sitting on their lap. She can be vocal about things she wants - dinner, attention, etc., She is an American Idol in the making and is in the process of learning to sing silently and will need someone to continue teaching her it is okay to sing to yourself. Koda has trust issues when it comes to dinner time and prefers to enjoy her meal in her crate. Her foster family is slowly introducing her to others at meal time.

Things I like: People! She loves to be around her humans. Snuggling up with them is one of her favorite pastimes. When she is not cuddling up, you will find her playing and running around in the backyard with her siblings or having fun time in the water.

Things I don't like: Being alone or ignored for long periods of time. Koda would love someone who works from home or who is only gone from home for short periods of time. As much as she loves playing in the water, bath time is not her favorite. She doesn't understand it helps keep her beautiful coat from shedding so much. She will need a daily brushing to help with her shedding as well.

Ideal home: Koda would do best where she can get lots of exercise, play time, and attention. A family who has time to be committed to her would be best, preferably with a backyard where she she could hang out with a furry sibling (medium to large sized dogs only).

Name: Jake

Breed: Labrador Retriever Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/4 yrs old/85lbs

Vetting: Jake is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped.

House trained/Crate Trained: Jake is currently living outside in a kennel due to not getting a long with others (see below). He is very quiet.

Dogs: Jake is very particular when it comes to other dogs. He has lived with them in the past, but he wasn't always nice. Since being rescued, Jake has spent time with a few dogs here and there, but it was totally on his terms. He played a little, but then he was done. For this reason, we believe Jake would do best with only one other dog (with slow introductions to ensure compatibility) or be ""the one and only"" in his new home.

Children: Jake tends to be very skittish around them because he is not sure what they will do. He would do best with older children who can understand how to treat animals with respect.

Cats: Jake has not been seen around cats, however he can be cat tested upon request.

Energy Level: Jake is very laid back. Jake loves taking walks and will follow you around.

Before FAR/My History: My previous owner got very sick and passed away. There were 6 of us. I was the last one that he rescued as a stray. I didn't know my dad very well, he got sick soon after he rescued me. I don't remember my previous life but I was a stray when my dad found me. I got along with my dog siblings but I was never quite comfortable around them. I do like other dogs but I need very slow introductions. I've never been around cats.

Training Status/Commands I know: I know my name and respond and come when called. I walk very well on a leash.

Working on: Getting Jake comfortable with new people and new situations due to an unfortunate past. But he is a big love when you get to know him.

Things I like: Jake loves chewing on marrow bones. He's also VERY food motivated and loves treats.

Things I don't like: I am very sensitive and I really like to see where your hands are when you approach me. I really appreciate a pet on my head first.

Things that make my humans happy: When I sit next to them and let them pet and talk to me. He seems to just love and want to be around people all the time!

Ideal Family/Home: Jake would love a home where it is quiet, no younger children around and probably would like to be the only dog. He would be great as a companion to someone who is lonely.

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/4yrs old/70 pounds

Vetting: Up to date on vaccines, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm positive (on slow kill treatment and rescue pays for treatment until negative)

House trained/Crate Trained: Yes to both.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Possibly dog selective, but can be tested upon request. He gets along well with his submissive foster canine. He would do better in a home without small dogs or cats. Tyson is very strong and can knock small children down, so he may do better in a home with older children.

Energy Level: Medium. He gets spurts of energy, but then calms back down. He loves to run and play fetch!

Before FAR: Tyson came in as a stray. He was skinny and in poor condition with skin issues. Now he is healthy, and looking and feeling great!

Training Status/Commands I know: Sit, down, place, and load up. Tyson walks well on a leash with a prong collar.

Things I like: Tyson loves to play ball!

Things I don't like: Tyson is a little hesitant of men he doesn't know and takes a little time to warm up.

Things that make my humans happy: That I am very sweet and loving! He is a smart boy and very eager to please!

Ideal Family/Home: Tyson would do best with a family who can continue his training and give him plenty of play and exercise time. A family with older children and no other small pets would be best.

Breed: Pit Bull Terrier Mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Female, 7 years old, about 40 lbs

Vetting: Fully vetted, HW Negative, spayed, microchipped

House trained/Crate trained: I love my crate and am happy to sleep and eat there, especially if I've got a good bone to chew to keep me occupied! I haven't had an accident inside the house in YEARS!

Dogs/Cats/Children: I prefer dogs that are big, calm, and friendly! Little dogs, cats, and young kids scare me. None of those please!

Energy Level: I love to play fetch with my ball and play with my toys, but I'm also happy to couch-potato around for most of the day. I'm also really good at keeping myself occupied and will even throw the ball for myself or run zoomie laps in the yard if you're too busy to play.

Before FAR: My foster mom found me asking for food at the neighbor's house. I was super skinny and had been on the street for a while, but no one would feed me because they couldn't have a dog and wanted me to go away. My foster mom took me in, got me healthy, taught me all the important house rules, and now I'm ready for my forever home!

Training Status: I REALLY want to do whatever makes you happy, so I'm really easy to train! I have good recall, can ""drop it"" on command (even the good stuff, like balls and treats!), and I know ""Off"", ""Go to your room"", ""Leave it"", ""Stay"", and ""Wait"". My foster mom taught me that it's not nice to jump on people without their permission (sometimes I still forget!), so she taught me the command ""Jump!"" where I leap into your arms so you can hold me like a baby! It's my favorite trick and makes me REALLY happy!

Things I like: I LOVE balls and toys! I will get them out every day and play with them and I'm pretty hilarious if I do say so myself! I also love to chew bones. But my FAVORITE thing is humans!! I can be happy for hours cuddling on the couch and staring lovingly into the eyes of any (adult) human who will pet me! Oh, and I love to give kisses!

Things I don't like: Sometimes when a dog I don't know well gets up in my face, I get really mad! I need really careful, slow introductions and prefer to just hang out with my own pack. Dog parks are NOT my jam! Little kids are weird and unpredictable and that freaks me out. I'd prefer my humans fully grown, please!

Ideal Family: I would love a family with one or two bigger dogs to be my friends! A pack of my very own! I don't want to be in charge and I'd like to have a stable, friendly big brother or sister to look up to. I'd also be okay with being the only dog and wouldn't even mind living in an apartment (I'm really quiet most of the time!), as long as I get lots of exercise when my human is home! I don't think I would mind older kids or teenagers in the home, but I've never really met any of those. I'd be willing to give it a shot if it means getting my very own family!

Special Notes: You'll be happy to know I'm not afraid of storms or loud noises and I don't mind you leaving me to go to work (as long as you bring me home ""the bacon""!). I don't shed very much at all and I love wearing sweaters and jackets in the winter (cuz my belly is naked and I get cold!). I'm not really that food motivated, so I'm not too interested in counter surfing or getting into the trash. Oh, and I know the difference between things that are mine (like toys and bones) and things that are yours (like shoes and chargers), but if I make a mistake at the beginning, just let me know and I won't do it again! I take my human's rules very seriously!

55504662,Otto,Pit Bull Terrier,Boxer,True,Adult,Male,Large,,,,Furever After Rescue,GA793,31210,6,True,,True,,False,"Macon, GA",N/A,Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered.","Meet Otto
Name: Otto

Breed: American Staffordshire/Boxer mix

Sex/Age/Weight: Male/4yrs old/60lbs

Vetting: Otto is fully vetted, neutered and heartworm negative, including a microchip.

House trained/Crate Trained: Still working on house training. Otto is very good in a crate.

Dogs/Cats/Children: Otto is good with other dogs. Very curious around cats and chickens but doesn't seem to want to hurt them. He's only been around older children but loved them.

Energy Level: Otto is a medium energy dog, loves to play and he gives hugs.

Before FAR/My History: I was found as a stray in Baldwin County, and I am thought to be the father of the Super K's litter.

Training Status/Commands I know: I know my name and respond and come when called.

Working on: Jumping on people, house breaking and leash manners

Things I like: Playing with tennis and any other sort of balls! LOVES playing with other dogs. He's also VERY food motivated and loves treats.

Things I don't like: He seems to not have anything he doesn't like..

Things that make my humans happy: Snuggles! He seems to just love and want to be around people all the time!

Ideal Family/Home: Otto is a medium energetic and playful boy so he would do great with an active family with a fenced yard who understands this and is willing to work with him on his leash manners and give him the time he needs to run and play. A home with other dogs would be ideal because he absolutely LOVES playing with other dogs.

Name: Sheba

Age/Sex/Weight: 6 years old/Female/37lbs

Breed: Bull Terrier Mix

Vetting: Spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on heartworm prevention.

House trained: Yes

Crate Trained: Yes

Before FAR: I was found as a pregnant stray. Luckily for me the rescue took me in, helped me have my babies and got them all adopted. Now I'm waiting for my Furever home!

Energy Level: Medium.

Things that make me happy: Humans, being the center of attention and getting lots of love and cuddles, walks, any time food comes out.

Things that make my humans happy: When I'm sweet and affectionate, when I run around in circles when food comes out or when it's time to go on a walk.

Working on: Laying down on command (I know sit stay, shake and high five already!); Being calm and not reactive around other dogs I don't know.

Dogs: I can be a bit selective, and need a dog that will accept me as ""the boss""

Cats: No

Ideal Family/Home: I would do best in a single dog home that is able to give me plenty of love and attention. Older children or no children at all would be best (I do love all kids though!). Because I tend to be reactive round other dogs I don't know or that also have dominant personalities, I need someone that is able to help me learn how to stay calm in these situations. I love my humans and am very loyal to them so would love to find a family that is the same with me!

I'm ready to meet you and find my Furever home!

49710624,Jupiter,Bull Terrier,Mixed Breed,True,Adult,Female,Medium,,,,Furever After Rescue,GA793,31210,6,,,True,,False,"Macon, GA",N/A,Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered.","Meet Jupiter
Name: Jupiter

Breed: Carolina Dog

Sex: Female

Age: 5

Weight: 40 lbs

Vetting: spayed, microchipped, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on heartworm prevention

House trained: Yes

Crate Trained: She is crate trained, but her first experience with them was when she was with animal control, so she doesn't love being in one.

Dogs: She has done well with male dogs, but has had personality issues with other females.

Cats: She hasn't been cat tested, but can upon request.

Energy Level: Her high energy side comes out when she wants to play. She will run and play tug-a-war with a maximum energy level, and she needs to play like this at least twice a day. But when she's done playing, she would love to just relax in the sunshine.

Things that make me happy: Food and scratches, specifically butt scratches, and being with her human man. She loves her foster mom and is very protective of her, but she will always want to be a daddy's girl. She is a terrible flirt and waits all day for an evening of snuggles with her foster dad. She loves her treats of raw carrots and green beans. She even knows the difference when given a choice and she will tell you which one she would prefer at that moment. And if you take the time to scratch her bum she will reward you by loudly purring.

Things that make my humans happy: She is so smart. She knows how to give a high five, a regular five, and a double five aka a ten. She also knows No, Sit, and Speak and is working on lying down. She sticks to her schedule of eating and going to the bathroom outside, so as long as her human is consistent all will be well.

Working on: Jupiter is still a bit wild when playing. She is not aggressive, but she doesn't always understand that humans don't play the same way as dogs. She needs someone who can handle a dog who uses her mouth when playing. She won't bite hard, but there could be the occasional nip when your hand is too close to her end of her tug rope. She is also built like a furry little tank and she may jump on you when playing (she doesn't jump otherwise) and you'll feel her compact weight and her nails.

Before FAR: Jupiter lived her first two years on her own as a stray until she was picked up by animal services and was rescued by Furever After Rescue just in time to avoid being euthanized. She was likely never a domestic dog before she was rescued. She doesn't show any signs of having been mistreated by humans, but she will always be skittish around and wary of people.

Special Notes: Jupiter is slightly skittish from having been on her own originally. She prefers the flight instead of fight reaction as her first instinct and will need her own special place to retreat to when she gets scared. She wants someone who will be patient with her and let her explore and understand what is expected of her.

Ideal Family/Home: Because of her size and background, she wouldn't be right in a household with younger children. She really needs a family that will be able to give her the love and attention she needs. She will want to sleep in the bed with you where she's not shy about being a bed hog, but she repays with sweet cuddles. She's good on a leash and loves a good walk, but not a long one, so she will need daily exercise through lots of playing. She would not be good in a home where her parents are gone 40+ hours a week. She is a special dog and needs a family that can appreciate her uniqueness.

When I first arrived at LOHS, I was really frightened and unsure of my surroundings. But with every gentle thump of my tail, every soft lick of my tongue, and the way I slowly inched closer to rest my chin on someone's lap, I started to show my true, loving nature.

Now, I'm in a wonderful foster home where I'm learning more about how to be loved and cared for. Despite my past, I have so much love to give and I'm ready to share it with my forever family.

Will you be the one to give me a forever home? Adopt me, and let's create beautiful memories together!"

Candy, an **outstandingly well-mannered** adult dog, has gracefully moved past the puppy stage of life. Her caramel-colored coat is as warm and inviting as her personality. She takes treats gently, savoring each bite with a gentle grace. When it comes to leash walks, Candy is a pro-she walks **perfectly on leash**, making every stroll enjoyable. But what truly sets her apart is her constant checking in with her handler. Whether it's a quick glance or a nudge, Candy wants to ensure that the bond between them remains strong.

But that's not all! Candy is a **social butterfly**. She greets everybody she meets with tail wags and friendly hellos. Life is better with friends, and Candy knows it. She deserves a loving family-a forever home where she can share her wisdom, loyalty, and unconditional love. If you're looking for a companion who radiates warmth and kindness, Candy is waiting to create beautiful memories with you. Adopt this sweet girl, and your days will be filled with joy and canine companionship. If you're interested in meeting Candy, don't hesitate to reach out. She's ready to be someone's loyal and loving companion!"

Hi! I am Jack! I was left tied up to a mailbox on a hot summer's night along with my sister. My sister has been adopted, but I remain still inside the home of the nice lady that found us.

I am looking for my own home, and I would prefer a home with another dog, size doesn't matter!! The lady I am living with has all sizes of dogs!!!

I need the companionship of another furry animal like myself. A cat would be fine too. I really like anything with 4 legs.

I love my lady's little humans too.

I am about 2 yrs old, no older than that and need my exercise since I am a GSD. A fenced in yard would be ideal!!

I am housebroken and have given my current foster absolutely no problems since moving in with her!!

I am not yet vetted, but will be next week!!

If you would like to meet me, please fill out an application here!!!

???NOELLE ???

Hi! I am Noelle and someone dumped me on a dirt road, and this scared me so bad.

Some nice lady found me and brought me to a place where they gave me some food. I was sooo hungry. I have not eaten much in a long time.

I am still scared because I am just a baby. I think I am about 4 months old, and life has been very scary for me.

I really would like someone to take me home and give me lots of good food and a warm place so I will fill safe.

I tremble. I am all alone. ?

Hey ~ I’m King and I now reside inside a foster home, where so much has been learned about me!!

I am 8.5 years old and am fully vetted!!

I am dog and cat friendly and don't mind little humans!!

I walk great on a leash, however, I don't wander and will stay with you in a yard, because ultimately, I want to be with you!!

I am crate trained and have no separation anxiety, so if you must leave me for a while, I will just sleep and wait for your return!!

It was noticed that I have a weak bladder and was urinating a lot, so I was taken to the doctor where diabetes was ruled out, but I may have Cushing's disease, so I am now on medication to help me!!! I feel soooo much better!!!

I am about 20 lbs and just a joy to be around. I love snuggles and just being with people!!

Even though I may require some daily medicine, I am still a happy and loving old man that would love to finally find my final home with stability and know that I will never have to leave another family.

My adoption fee is $50 and applications can be found here:

They say I’m about 9 weeks old so I have a long life to share with someone that will love me forever! I love to cuddle with humans. They have been keeping me safe since I had to leave my mommy!

I have had my puppy shots, and will be fully vetted after Christmas when I am old enough!!

Hi everyone! My name is Marsh! I had to be trapped in a cage with food because me, my sisters and my mama were really scared of humans. I have been hanging out with my sisters, Krispy and Mellow with this really crazy lady that giggles at us all the time. She says I remind her of “Happy Feet”, whatever that means. I do get to play with other doggy’s that are bigger than me but I keep up with them pretty good! I would like to find a home where I can be with people all the time and not be called “feral”. That’s a silly name because I love people now and I even walk really good on a leash when we go outside! They say I’m about 7-9weeks old so I have a long life to share with someone that will love me forever!"

Hi everyone! I finally followed the path of my brother and sister and caught up to them! I got really excited to see them because I found out the cage that caught me was so I could learn how great people are! I get to play with Marsh and Malllow but OH MY GOODNESS…. I get to play with other dogs and people! Can you give me a home to call my own so I can find more little people and/or other doggy’s to play with?

Hi! I am Kodiak, or Kodi!!

I came inside AC because humans failed me, TWICE and this is to NO FAULT of my own!!!

I have the best manners, I am a quiet and smart guy with so much love in my faces, eyes and heart....

I am young, no more than 2 and am housebroken, crate trained and dog friendly.

The people that turned me in said I don't like cats ~ but no one can vouch for that inside AC...

I am a big boy, about 60 lbs, am already vetted and really want to leave animal control.

I do not belong here. Every time the ladies come by my kennel, I wag my tail thinking it's my time to leave, but here I continue to sit.

If you want to meet me, please come to Jasper County animal control and I will be sitting on the front row with anticipation."

Hi, I'm Saint...

I came inside animal control because my brother and I were wandering around lost and scared...

I am still afraid and all alone. My brother is no longer with me, and I am confused and just want to sit and be loved on.

The ladies like loving on me and telling me that everything will be ok, but it's too loud where I am, and I don't like all the noise. I want to be where it's peaceful.

They think I am about a year old, and that I shouldn't grow anymore.

I am fully vetted and ready to find a different place to lay down. I don't like the doghouse that they have given me, and the concrete isn't very soft.

If you would like to meet me, I can be found at Jasper County Animal Control."

I just love the wrinkles on your face! - said no one ever about me, but THIS girl oh my heart! Look at this smushy face baby!

COOKIE is 5 or 6 months old and is a very shy girl. She was terrified in the shelter, curled into a ball facing the wall, trembling. After just a few weeks of TLC from a foster mom who adores her, COOKIE has become brave enough to take long leash walks with her foster sister pups. She loves rolling in the dry grass and politely lets you know when it's time for a belly rub. She is very affectionate and loves for you to scratch her ears and wrinkles.

COOKIE needs a loving family who can patiently allow her to blossom Each day she becomes braver and tries new things that scare her. We are so proud of the progress she's making and think it would be best if she starts attaching herself to her forever person instead of being so dependent on her foster mom for comfort and courage.

COOKIE gets along well with other dogs and would love another pup to play with. She might do best with a confident mature dog who can show her the ropes.

COOKIE will be spayed, microchipped and fully vaccinated after this week and ready for her new home. Be aware that her foster mom will be VERY picky deciding which lucky family gets this gem. COOKIE is very loved

Hi friends! My name is Prince!

–- 11 month old good boy (est. DOB 11/2023)
-– Around 45 pounds
-– Neutered, vaccinated, microchipped
-- Potty trained
-- Crate trained
-- Dog friendly

I love to do zoomies and play! Though shy and timid at first, I warm up quickly. I am a shadow dog who will be someone’s very best friend.

I had a rough start, but the worst day of my life also turned into my best day. I lived at a business with my mama who had been there for years. Sadly, my mama was hit and killed. I was so lost and frantic, but lucky for me, I was also rescued later that same day.

One of my eyes looks a little special. That is all it is – cosmetic and makes me special! The humans don’t think I can see out of my right eye, but it is not causing me any discomfort or issues. The doctors chose not to remove it since there was no medical reason to – it just looks a little different.

If you are interested in meeting me, complete an adoption application at joyspromise.org/adopt and let’s get this pawty rolling!

Honey bun is beginning the search for her forever home.

BASICS: Female, 2.5 years old, 50 pounds
VETTING: Spayed, vaccinated, microchipped
COMPATIBILITY: Cat friendly, can be dog friendly (see below)
OTHER: Potty trained, low to medium energy, no young kids

We know, this is a super duper long bio. We would be doing Honey and her future human a disservice though if we just snipped it down to the basics and a few cute sentences. Honey deserves more, so does her wonderful future human who will love her wholeheartedly.

Honey lived on the streets by herself for over a year. In that time, she was faced with having at least two litters of puppies as just a baby herself, scavenging for food and being hit by cars multiple times. We rescued Honey in fall of 2023 and she had both a broken hip and heartworms. It is a miracle she made it as long as she did. Honey has spent several months getting necessary medical care from heartworm treatment to hip surgery, and she has finally finished it all!

Honey is looking for a very special and patient adopter who will show her kindness, help her continue to blossom and give her grace as she gets there.

After living on her own for so long, Honey is still trying to figure out life off the streets. She can get overwhelmed by new changes, new people, new environments. Overwhelmed by the world outside of her safe bubbles, you could say. She loves her safe bubbles (e.g. foster homes) and is still learning that there is more to life, more safe bubbles, than one.

Honey’s heart for her people is bigger than the moon. She adores her people and she is loyal to a fault to her people. Once she settles in and chooses you, she chooses you wholeheartedly. Her personality starts to show in little moments that make your heart flutter and feel so proud. Before you know it, she is doing bunny hops in excitement to see you and “talking” excitedly at dinner time.

KIDS: As Honey is still trying to build confidence and integrate into life off the streets, she is not a match for a home with young children. Kiddos make lots of noise and fast movements, which scares Honey and isn’t her jam.

CATS: Honey is cat friendly. She has done great living with cats in her foster home.

DOGS: Honey could either be the only dog in home, or she could potentially live with other dogs if the right match and slow intros. Honey lived in a foster home with multiple dogs for months and did great. She does not care to play, but she does not mind hanging together either as long as the other pups leave her be. Co-existing happily versus being buddies – that is Honey’s style. Honey may do well with a lowkey, low energy dog who just likes to hang and keep to themself too.

FENCE: Honey does NOT have to have a fenced yard. She has lived both in a foster home with one and without one. However, Honey CAN chew through chain link fencing if she gets spooked enough to feel like she needs to. She can go to a home with or without a fence, but Honey is a FLIGHT RISK and precautions must be taken either way to keep her safe (we will help you figure those precautions out).

OTHER: Honey is fully potty trained (super holder). Her energy level is low to medium. She is pretty easy on a leash and non-reactive to other dogs. Car rides are not her favorite as far as getting in, but she rides calmly and quietly once in. Honey is crated regularly and does well, though she may have an “oopsie” moment trying to get out the first week or two - but smooth sailing after that.

Raw truth: We know it may take some time to find Honey’s right person. That person is out there though, and it will be a match made in heaven when the paths do cross. Someone will grow to love Honey *almost* as much as she loves them. They will celebrate her milestones and progress like we have. They will get to know the true Honey and love her with their whole heart. Honey’s person is out there.

If you read this far and think you might be Honey’s person, complete an application and let’s talk! Her meet and greets might not look like the “norm”. She will be nervous, shy, and uneasy. If you can look past that though and give her a chance, you might just look back realizing it was one of the best decisions you ever made. You might just think to yourself one day that you simply couldn’t imagine life without her.

I now live with a nice family who is teaching me how to potty outside and I'M A CHAMP, from what I am told!!!

I live with another dog and cats and I love them all!!!

I am about 5 mos old and have had my shots, but too little to be fixed. They say that will be my Christmas present.

I weigh around 20 lbs, and they think I will be my mama's size, who is 25lbs.

They say I have a funny personality, and call me a PISTOL!!!

My adoption fee is $200 (which will include ALL my vetting, including my neuter)

Hi! I am BALOO!!!

I was brought to Jasper Shelter because I was wandering around, and my family never came to find me.

I am one of the volunteer's favorites because every time I see her, I shake with excitement and wiggle my whole body because she gives me attention!!

I don't like being in this cold, dark place where there is so much noise. My kennel does not get sunshine so it's not a fun place to stay all day long.

I am young and just want to be outside where I can play and rub my belly on the grass. I love to lie in the sunshine and have my head scratched. That doesn't happen too often in this dark place.

The volunteer brings her dog so that I can play with her, and we have so much funny chasing each other. She's my best friend but I don't get to see her very often.

I have had all my shots and am neutered and now they say I am ready to be adopted because the shelter is full. I need a home. I don't have one and they keep saying I need to get out. I want to get out, I just don't know how to. I try and tell all the people that I am ready too ~ tell me how to do it!!!

They say you have to fill out the paperwork here so I can go home. Please do that for me. I have so much love to give.

My adoption fee is $50

Hey!! My name is TOGA ~ street name EARS

I was brought in because my owners had me locked outside in a crate. The neighbors thought that was mean, so they called animal control. I am soooo thankful they did. I could've died inside that crate.

I now live Jasper Shelter where I am very happy!!

I am one happy girl, as nothing makes me sad!! Life is short and I live each day to the fullest. There is rumor that some have limited days here, so I make sure to be the bestest girl ever!!!

I am a young girl, around 1.5 yrs old and have had all my shots and am now spayed.

There's rumor that I am not the zoomie king, but I do claim the Zoomie Queen title!!

I love to run and play outside with my friends!! We have the best time just chasing each other or chasing a toy!!! It's a lot more fun than lying in my dark, damp and cold kennel.

Each time someone comes near me, I get soooo excited hoping they will take me out to play!!!

I am not a very big girl. I am what they call a lowrider...only about 45lbs and they tell me most of that weight is MY EARS!!!! I just laugh and laugh!! I see others with big ears too and I like them!!!

Even though I am soooo happy here, I would like to find a home where I can be a part of a loving family.

I want to bring my happiness inside a family who will want to laugh and be happy with me on a daily basis. I am tired of living in a depressed atmosphere as that is not my gig!!!

If you have a loving home, and a fenced in yard for me to practice my zoomies, and space to hold me AND my ears, please fill out the application here. Please hurry. I will keep being the happy girl that I am, but with space limited my time may be up sooner rather than later.

Hi! My name is Kira and I had a roomie inside this scary place, but he has been adopted and now I'm all alone.

I was surrendered by my owner because they couldn't keep me safe and contained.

I came into the shelter very shy but have learned that the people that work there are very nice and that I have nothing to be afraid of!!!

I am young, less than 2, and have had my shots and am fixed.

I don't know what that thing is that they put around my neck. I don't like it. However, they put a harness on me, and I don't mind walking beside someone with that on me!!

I love other dogs and love to play!! I don't know my name so my recall isn't that good, but I am learning that when you speak, I am to come to you and that you will give me pets!! I really like that!!

I keep hearing that Jasper Shelter is full, and that dogs need to leave, so I am hoping that I will be one that will be able to find a family!!!

I am not a big girl, about 40lbs and would love to find a family that I can trust not to ever hurt me again so that I can live happily and without fear.

If you are my family, and want to meet me and bring me home, fill this paper out here so we can meet!!

My name is TILLY!!!

I have had a rough go in my short 6 mos of life

I was brought into a scary place that they call animal control where I kept getting sicker and sicker

My skin was itchy and I had a cold that I couldn't beat

A nice lady took me into her outdoor kennel and gave me medicine, but I still didn't get better so I went to the hospital and spent a few nights having breathing treatments which made me feel so much better.

Once I felt better, another nice lady took me home and is fostering me. I have a big brother that I love to play with and a thing that meows that I like too!!

My doctor says I will probably need medicine for my itchy skin during allergy seasons but maybe when I get bigger and my immune system grows, I won't need any more medicine!!!!

I have had all my shots, and just had my spay surgery yesterday so now they say I can find my own home that makes me excited!!!

I go to the potty outside and am learning how to be calm around people. They just make me so happy!!! I love the way they walk on only 2 legs and I try to do that too!!!

I love to snuggle on the couch and watch football with my foster mom and brother. Sundays are the BEST!!!

If you want me to watch football too, and have a fenced in yard where I can play, please fill out this paper so I can meet you!!

Hi! I am Lenny, or Leonard as my foster mom sometimes lovingly referrs to me by!!

My story is unknown, but my scars would reveal an unpleasant one.

My foster mom saved my life ~ literally as she busted me out of AC, and allowed me to decompress and heal from traumatic memories

I am so happy here!!! I get sooooo excited when my foster mama comes and lets me out of my kennel ~ but am in an outdoor kennel and I shiver when the temperature drops. I want to be inside my foster's home, but her dogs won't allow me to be an inside foster dog :(

I play with the dogs that will allow me to play with them, and we just run and chase things that are thrown in the yard....

I like making my foster mom laugh ~ she says I'm quite the character and then we both laugh at each other!!!

My foster mom doesn't have a lot of time to spend with me and the other fosters, so I really would like to find a family that would accept my scars, externally as well as internally and allow me to be just me!!!

My adoption fee is $50 and I have been fully vetted and kept on HW/flea and tick prevention!!

Hi! I am Cowboy and I have been inside Jasper Shelter for too long.

The word inside this joint is that they are full, and dogs need to get out, that time is up.

That excites me, because since I've been waiting for so long, that must mean my time is up and a home is out there ~ right???

I am around 3 yrs old, had my shots, no longer carrying so anytime you want to bust me outta here, I'm game.

I love to play and tolerate others. Would prefer to have a female chick beside me, ya know??

I am tired of living inside a cage, and really need space to mark my own, a family to claim and protect.

Hi! I am Gemma

They also call me Hippo, which is RUDE!! I have curves in ALL the right places!! I am as round as I am tall, is that a problem??

I hear that I have been in here as one of the longest residents of Jasper Shelter but, I have no worries because I am one of their favorites ~ right? I am safe? Right?

They tell me every day that they love me, so yeah, I'm safe!!???

I am somewhere between 3-5 yrs old and sassy inside this kennel. They tell me it's only because I am scared and annoyed at my surroundings, and I think they may be right because I love attention and to sit in laps once I am up in the play yard. I think I'm just sleepy. You don't get much sleep inside this place.

I love to chase the ball and sit my sassy self down in the grass and sunbathe. Grass belly rubs aren't bad either.

I like some dogs. Others annoy me.

I haven't been fixed yet, but they tell me I will be as soon as they have an approved application in on me.

They say my time is up, but I don't believe that. I am too cute to be worried. Everyone loves hippos.

If you are afraid for me and want to make sure that I am safe and welcome me into your home, you can fill out this application. If you have another dog, then lets go on a date and see if I approve, but ya still have to fill out an application.

Thanks for listening to my story.

Hello! My name is Pumpkin

I am THE LONGEST resident of Jasper Shelter, so I hold that title ~ yay me!!!
I was found on a chain in a backyard. My chain hurt me and cut my neck so badly that I needed medical attention.

I am so grateful that someone called animal control and that they came and saved me. It hurt me really badly.

I am about 3 yrs old and have had all my shots and am fixed.

They say I don't like all people, and I guess I don't. People put things on you that hurt and cut you.

The people at animal control say they love me, and I believe them now because they have shown me that they don't hurt me and I love them too.

They are the nicest people to me, and I want to stay here forever, but they say I can't. They say I have to leave because the shelter is full, and I have been here the longest and I need to be nice and learn to trust all people.

I want to trust all people. I need a family that will show me that they are ok and that they won't hurt me. I am a beagle mix and beagles are sweet. I want to be a beagle.

If you will let me, come live with you, because they say my time is up and that I need to leave, if you will let me be a beagle and learn to trust you, I will give you kisses, and tail wags and I will let you hold me in your lap!!! We will be so happy together!!!

My name is Marley!!!

I was found roaming around, searching for food in Jasper County because I was hungry.

I was brought into a scary place where I had to live for a while until a nice lady got me out.

I went to live at a foster home for a couple of weeks, but the cat didn't like me, so I had to go live inside a boarding place.

I am about 2 yrs old, have had all my shots and I am fixed.

I know how to use the potty outside which is why I don't like the boarding place. I try and hold my bladder because I dont' like the way it splashes onto my feet, but it has made me sick, and I got an UTI and had to have medicine. I feel better now, but I still hold my bladder.

I do have itchy skin during allergy season, but I am on a Zyrtec a day and that helps!! The vet told me that most dogs with my color have itchy skin. I may have to have a low dose of prednisone during allergy season, but a new dog food I eat is helping a lot!!

I like other dogs and cats are ok, but they don't like me for some reason. I guess I scare them.

I love the little people and all people!!! They say I am soooo soooo sweet!!!

If you want to meet me, please fill out the paperwork that is required and they will put it in my file and find you if I still don't have a home next week.

I like going to the adoption events, but they say I am getting sad and really need to find my people soon. Are you my people?

Hi. My name is Jo~Jo. I was found tethered in my backyard by a family who I thought loved me.

I came into their life, which was once full of love, and I guess because I got bigger, they decided to just keep me chained up.

These nice people saved me from a loud and dark place, but they also couldn't bring me home so they put me into a boarding facility, where my play time is limited. I don't like it here.

I am about 2 yrs old and have never been able to run and play like a puppy should. I hear running and playing is very fun, but I wouldn't know that.

These nice people come every weekend and take me to these events where people come and meet me and tell me how pretty I am and what a good boy I am, but I guess the right people haven't met me.

Would you be interested in bringing me home so I can run and play and have a family?

I am fully vetted, and I LOVE girl dogs, as they seem to like me too!!

I like to run and play, but also like to sit on the couch as I find the TV very interesting.

I have been saved from my cold, dark and damp jail cell by a nice lady!!

I have been put into a foster family, where I coexist with another dog, and 4 little humans!!

They say I am a nanny dog, because I adore children BUT, I am 85lbs and sometimes play with my canine sister and tend to knock down the small little humans, so they think maybe little humans shouldn't be around me while I play :(

I am housebroken and crate trained and am need of my own home since the foster family now has 2 big dogs and 4 tiny humans. It's a little overwhelming for them!!

It's also been discovered recently that I have something called degenerative disk disease, but the doctor says that a monthly injection will keep me comfortable!!!

I also have inherited from my parents, the pink pigmentation where my skin stays pink. But, the doctor says once the stress is out of my life, and when I am in a stable environment on a good diet, this should go away!!!

I am a velcro dog, and just want to be close to my people.

Hi!! My name is Trooper!!!

My sister and I were left by our daddy, tied to a church many months ago.

My daddy became homeless and had nowhere for us to live so thought someone at the church would take us home to live with them. He left our beds, food and toys but instead a big scary truck came to pick us up and take us into a scary building where we stayed for several weeks.

Some nice ladies took us out because my sister was so scared inside there.
My sister is with a family on a trial, and I am now all by myself in an outdoor kennel where I am cold.

I remember living with my daddy inside a house where I got to sleep in the bed with him.

I am about 4 yrs old and some sort of Setter/Pointer mix. I have had all my shots and am fixed.

I know how to go to the potty outside and not in my home. I am a sweet and goofy boy that loves playing with other dogs. Cats don't bother me. They scare other dogs, but not me.

I LOVE little people!! My daddy used to make me, and my sister pull them around on a cart and I loved that!! I loved to hear their laughs!!

I am lonely and want to be back inside a warm house, with my own bed and my own people.

I get to go to adoption events and so many people want to meet me, but no one has ever filled out the paperwork. If you have a home with a fenced in yard that I can come into and be a part of our family, please fill out the paperwork. I have patiently waited for my family.

Hi! I am Rhys.

I am told I was named after a strong and handsome character in a book because a nice lady thought I had the same characteristics.

I was brought into animal control as a 6 mos old puppy with a chain around my neck that had to be cut off of me.

I am now 1 year old and still don't have a family of my own.

After living in animal control for a couple of months, a nice lady took me into her home and fosters me. I have a canine sister that l adore and we play ALL THE TIME!!! I sometimes get on her nerves because she wants to be lazy.

I potty outside and have just learned to lift my leg on the bushes (and sometimes my sister because I am learning)

I love cuddling with my foster mom, and she buys me all sorts of fun toys and she even makes me my own treats!!!

My foster mom works from home, so sometimes she has to put me in a crate while she is on a phone call and she says I am such a good boy for being quiet!!!
She took me to the beach this summer and I loved playing in the ocean because I LOVE THE WATER!!!!

They say I have eyes as blue as the ocean ~ maybe that's why I like water sooooo much!!??

I have had all my shots and am fixed and really want to find my own family where we can all grow up together!!

Hi! I am Buddy and my son is Nemo.
I am 9 yrs old and am a special needs guy. My son is 7 yrs old and has no disabilities other than being very shy.

We have been together Nemo's whole life, and he is my best friend and we love each other very much. We never want to be in separate homes but to remain together forever.

We lived in a small outdoor kennel together for many, many years until a nice lady picked us up and took us to her house to foster.

I am deaf, but my foster mom as taught me sign language and she says that I am super smart. I also have no vision in one eye.

I love to be with people and love other animals. Nothing phases me. I love everything that I come into contact with.

I may be special needs, but my heart is 100% full of love. People say I am as sweet as they come.

My son, Nemo was never properly socialized and learned that not all people are kind, so he has me as his security blanket. Nemo likes his foster family and has learned that it is ok to wag his tail and show affection.

I am constantly telling him that he is now safe and to enjoy life, and he is learning that I am correct. Aren't parents always?

We now get to come inside our fosters home, and we enjoy being a part of their family. We are allowed to lie on couches, which I love to do, but Nemo is still afraid of the couch and prefers to lie on the floor.

We both know how to potty outside and love playing with the other dogs inside the fosters home.

They say that I am always smiling, which is true, because I've never been more happier in my life.

We both have had all our shots and have been neutered and now need to find our own home so our foster can have hers back. She says she has too many living inside, and we don't want to go back outside where it is cold. We love it so much inside.

I am a double Merle Aussie and Nemo is all me, but I can't remember who his mama was, so we call him a mix.

We have both been told that we are very handsome and that is all that matters.
If you have a patient home, that will allow us to acclimate inside your family, AND a fenced in yard to keep both of us safe, please fill out the paperwork to meet us...Nemo and I are desperately needing a safe and a family willing to overlook my handicaps but instead concentrate on the love that I want to share with my family.

Hi! My name is Murphy.

I was found in the middle of the road. I escaped from my home because my owner kept me on a chain ALL the time. Part of my chain was still on my neck when a nice girl found me. She took my chain off, but my hair is now gray where that mean chain was on my neck

The girl promised I would never go back on a chain, but I am now in a kennel, which is still sad.

The vet says I am about 4 yrs old and I have had all my shots and am neutered.
They say I am a hound dog but also maybe Rottie because I have a docked tail
I get to go to adoption events where I sit so quietly. The ladies think maybe that is why no one ever sees me. I am so good and if I was loud then maybe people would see me.

The ladies say I have sad eyes and that I need a home all of my own where I can get all the attention that I need. I like attention. They call me a Velcro dog because I like being with people outside.

All the ladies love to kiss my snout. They say I have soft fur and I love it when they kiss me.

I like playing with other dogs, but since I like to chase squirrels, the ladies say I probably would like to chase cats too.

I love little humans and want to lick them. They are my size, and I think that is cool!!!

Since I have always lived on a chain, I don't know what the inside of a house is like, but I sure would like to find out. I see dogs and people go inside a door all the time and would like to go too, but I am not allowed at my foster home.
If you have a home that I could come in and learn how to be an inside dog, I would love you forever. I only dream of what that is like.

I also need a fence to keep me safe since I do have a hound dog's nose...
If you want to meet me and can give me all of that and more, please fill this paperwork out so that I can get out of my kennel. I am sad.

I like to play with other dogs, but they say I am not high energy like some of the other dogs. I am a very chill boy that wants nothing more to be with a person.
I love to go on car rides and explore trails. I would love to be in an exciting home where the family would take me to different places for me to sniff.

My perfect family would let me inside to snuggle and have a fenced in yard for me to explore. I sometimes get excited when I see an animal smaller than me, not that I would hurt them intentionally, but my excitement may cause them to be afraid of me. I am a big boy at 60lbs.

My perfect family would take me on excursions, even if just to get a pup cup because I like car rides.

If you are my perfect family, please fill out the form below so we can meet each other!

Hi! My name is Ranger and I have lived with Jasper County Humane Society for the longest.

I wandered into someone's garage last year because I was homeless, cold and hungry.

They found me sleeping on their Ranger one morning and I was named for that. They gave me food and water and tried to keep me until my people found me but that never happened, so they had to take me to a scary building where I was terrified.

I had to live there for many months and did not like it.

A nice lady took me to her kennel where she has fostered me all summer. She would throw the ball with me for long periods of time!!! I love the ball!!!

Someone offered to foster me inside their home where I was warm and safe.
They told me what a good boy I was, helped me with my manners, threw the ball with me and I loved their little people.

They had a little senior chihuahua that I liked but one day we had an argument over a piece of food and because I am so much bigger than him, the foster family sent me back. I didn't mean to scare the little dude, I just wanted that piece of food.

My foster dad worked from home and told me what a good boy I was because I liked lying beside him at his desk.

I know how to potty outside and how to be a good boy inside.

I am now back in an outdoor kennel and am sad. I want to go back inside with a family. I don't want a family with cats though!!! They scare me!!

I get to go to all the adoption events and am a pro at it!!! They say I am such a sweet boy and so well behaved as I sit there. But I am getting annoyed. I don't understand why I keep getting shuffled around. I want to find somewhere to stay and never have to leave.

I am about 2 yrs old, maybe 3 now and have had all my shots and am neutered.
It's getting cold outside, and my short hair doesn't keep me warm. I want to be inside where I can have a family with me to snuggle.

If you want to let me live with you inside and have a fenced in yard where you will throw me my ball, please fill out the paperwork here:

My name is Clyde

On St Patty's Day weekend, my sister (Bonnie) and I were dropped off by our family at a stop sign in Jasper County. We don't know why and we were so afraid. We never left that stop sign because we thought our family would come back to get us.

3 days later, a truck came and picked us both up and took us to a scary place. We lived there for a couple of months until we were taken to a fosters home to live outside.

My sister found her a family, but I had to go into a boarding facility, which makes me very sad. I don't like to use the bathroom on the concrete floors so I hold it as long as I can. I have had an UTI because I am trying so hard not to use the bathroom where I sleep.

I miss having a family of my own, and all the people around me say my eyes look sad.

The people say I am such a good boy and since I am a boxer mix and so sweet, I don't understand why people don't want me.

I get to go on field trips every weekend to adoption events and people always say that I am so beautiful, but no one will give me a chance. Maybe because I am a big boy?? Or maybe because I don't like cats. Cats scare me and I don't want to be around them.

But, I do like being around little humans and would love to have one that I can sleep with.

They think I am about 2, maybe 3. I love to play, but I don't have a lot of energy like some dogs. I am not a crazy wild boy like I have heard them call other dogs. I have had all my shots and am fixed like a big boy.

I would like to have a nice house that is all my own again and not have to live in a concrete kennel like I have been in for almost 8 months. I want to use the potty on grass or a bush. I don't like holding my potty. It hurts.

If you have a house with a fenced in yard where I can be safe, please help me get out of this boarding place and fill the paper out here:

Winston has cancer that is terminal and is desperately looking for a place to land for his final home. This is what his current foster has to say about him:

Winston is a wonderful, outgoing, and even-keel dog who is equally happy to peruse on a walk or cuddle on the couch. He has the curiosity of a puppy, but the energy of a gentle old man. He will happily follow you around the house to see what you're up to, and then find a comfy spot and start snoozing nearby.

Winston likes car rides, scritches, snacks, affection, cuddles, and naps.

Winston dislikes toys that don't hold up (he's a very strong chewer)

All foster dogs are fully vetted, altered, microchipped and on monthly HW/flea/tick prevention!!

We are open 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday, we schedule our last adoption at 4pm everyday to allow our staff enough time to feed and walk dogs.
We are an animal shelter and therefore are not able to individually potty train our residents. Many adult dogs do arrive ""house broken"" however due to animal behavior any change in environment will make an emotional impact on the animals and therefore initiate unwanted behaviors during the acclamation period. Please keep this in mind. Puppies do not have the biological maturity to maintain absolute bladder or bowel control and will require a certain degree of potty training and house breaking. Please consider the time and commitment it takes to provide the necessary building blocks for these special babies, prior to submitting your application.

Hi! My name is Trinity. I am a sweet girl that just needs a person/ family that will take the time to train me so I am prepared to join society, and so I will be well behaved no matter what's going on. I do have a lot of energy and can be rowdy sometimes, which isn't a bad thing, but maybe no small kids or animals.

When we first meet Oscar he was in bad shape. He had survived a vicious attack and needed a lot of medical attention.

It took months of care, but Oscar healed and looks beautiful. He is smart, playful, and funny. Oscar loves toys, a kiddy pool, and leash walks. He especially loves to cuddle. Oscar is affectionate and just needs the right person to meet him and give him the home he so deserves.

Meet Carson Dukes. His eyes (one blue, one brown) are unique and strikingly gorgeous, one myth even says that dogs with two different color eyes can view heaven and earth at the same time.

Carson is an adult Border Collie mix who has been with us since he was just a pup. Like some of our others he can be a bit shy and timid around new people so he would benefit from an adopter who is willing to spend some time with him at our kennel. Once he figures out who will be his friend he is very loving. Oh, and he is a bit of an escape artist, six feet or chain link does not hold a challenge for him. He never leaves us; he just doesn't like to be fenced. Carson would be a great indoor companion with supervised outdoor exercise.

Carson recently spent some time in a foster home. He adjusted well to being a house dog, is crate trained, and almost housebroken. He got along with the other dogs, really enjoyed stretching his long legs running and playing in the yard, and was happily contained with the 8ft privacy fence. His foster family describes him as, ""lovable, sweet, playful, and quirky in the most endearing way.""

Carson's adoption fee includes neuter, microchip, current vaccinations, and up to date heartworm/flea/tick prevention.

Enola's exuberance for life is contagious, and she's always ready to shower everyone with her abundant love.

Enola is a bundle of energy and thrives on staying active and engaged. Her love for play knows no bounds, and she's enthusiastic about any game or toy you throw her way. Fetch is her ultimate favorite; she'd chase a ball or a frisbee all day if she could! Long walks are also a highlight of her day, as they offer ample opportunities to explore the world and interact with people and other dogs.

One of Enola's endearing traits is her ability to express her opinions clearly. She's not afraid to vocalize her thoughts and feelings, using adorable barks and whines to communicate. It's almost like she's trying to have a conversation with her human companions! This expressive nature adds an extra layer of charm to her already lovable personality.

Enola is an eye-catching beauty with a short creamy-colored coat that gleams under the sunlight. Her sleek and muscular physique gives her a sturdy and confident appearance. The most captivating feature of her face is her large, dark, expressive eyes that can melt anyone's heart with a single glance. Whether she's excited, happy, or in need of some extra cuddles, her eyes say it all.

Have you ever wanted a pet that loves you and your family and no one else? That will adore you and their pack, but outsiders are viewed with caution? Well, meet Shirley. Shirley is a semi-feral pup. She was born apx May 2018. Shirley was trapped with her siblings by animal control. It will take patience and trust to seek human company. Shirley is ok with most other dogs and is fine with cats, actually a bit scared of some of them. She loves our office kitty Dean and he loves her. She loves her toys; she will run around with them and do zoomies. She will bond with her family and be a devoted family member. All it takes is time and patience. Shirley is available for foster to adopt. This will allow Street Paws to provide all the help and support their new family needs to begin their lives together. Ferals make excellent pets with just a little time. They usually are very laid-back and easy dogs once you gain their trust. A home with a fenced-in yard or kennel for potty time is strongly encouraged. She is not an ideal dog for children. Contact us if you are interested in becoming a member of our growing Street Paws pack!

She currently lives at our office. She has a doggie door that she uses to get into her outdoor house. She zoomies when she sees her caretaker arrive. Loves treat time! She likes to sneak the cat food bowls and take them to her bed. She did great with her recent vet checkup.

We verify vet history on current/previous pets to ensure pets have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated annually. Please call your vet to give permission for us to call them. Our adoption fee is $250. They have been given age-appropriate vaccinations, are spayed/neutered, heartworm tested and treated, if necessary, dewormed, have received flea prevention, and are micro-chipped. We will ensure the microchip is registered.

If more information is needed regarding the pet email info@streetpaws.org. You must complete the pre-application to obtain approval to meet the pet."

Bennett was pulled by us from Newton County Animal Control a day before he was to be euthanized. Bennett was a little skinny when we got him, so we put some groceries on him and he is now ready to find his fur-ever home! He is currently at 67lbs. We used a dog breed app to determine his breed and it said he is a mix of Doberman Pinscher and Australian Kelpie . He is about 1-1/2 years old, neutered, up to date on vaccines, micro-chipped, heartworm negative and on flea/tick/heartworm prevention. Being so young he has a lot of energy. Bennett's a happy, fun loving dog! He has had play dates with our doctor's dog and they got along great. One of our vet techs took him on a run with her and he ran well right along side her. He enjoys going on walks and is calm in his kennel and doesn't get bothered with dogs barking around him. He loves a good stuffed animal to throw around the yard and carry in his mouth. But he can be cuddly too and will rest his head against your shoulder when you go in his kennel with him. If you're interested in meeting Bennett make an appointment to meet him by calling 770-787-4899. Adoption application and interview required for adoption. He is located at Ross Animal Hospital, Covington GA."

Meet Dean, the canine connoisseur of bed lounging and belly rubs, who's been crashing at our place (the shelter) since March 2022. This furry cuddle machine is convinced he's a lap dog, and we haven't had the heart to tell him otherwise. When he's not auditioning for the role of ""most loyal pup ever,"" he's busy being a self-appointed security guard, keeping his territory safe from suspicious newcomers and rogue volunteers. Dean can be selective about people and dogs so if you have a furry friend already a meet and greet will be necessary. If Dean selects you though boy, he will be your furry companion and love all the attention he can get.

Dean's got a bit of a diva streak with his allergies, but a few meds and he's good to go. He's on the lookout for a savvy dog parent with no small children – he's not interested in being anyone's jungle gym. If you're in the market for a fiercely loyal, protect-and-serve pup with a penchant for snuggles, Dean's your guy. Apply to adopt this four-legged legend today!

The Great Doggo Split

Once upon a time in a bustling shelter, two Jack Russell Terriers named Bear and Benji lived a life filled with tail wags, mischief, and more than a few shenanigans. These two were the ultimate dynamic duo—think Batman and Robin, but with more fur and less crime-fighting. Bear, the larger of the two, had a flair for the dramatic, while Benji was the sweet, lovable sidekick who adored his brother and often found himself swept up in Bear's antics.

After years of waiting for their forever homes, the staff at the shelter decided it was time for a big change. They sat Bear and Benji down for ""the talk."" You know the one: ""Boys, you’re great together, but you might actually be too much together."" Bear looked at Benji, and Benji looked at Bear. They knew this day would come—the day they’d be set free, but possibly in different directions.

“I’m not saying we’re bad,” Bear said, licking his paw with all the confidence of a pup who had just stolen a whole steak off the kitchen counter. “I’m saying we’re… misunderstood. Right, Benji?”

“Misunderstood?” Benji echoed, a plush, stuffing-free toy hanging from his mouth like a bizarre trophy.

With that, Bear puffed out his chest. “We bring excitement! We’re like a rollercoaster! A thrilling ride of barks and zoomies! Plus, who doesn’t love a good game of tug-of-war that ends with us accidentally unrolling the entire toilet paper roll?”

Benji nodded, recalling the glory of that epic mess. But deep down, he started to feel that maybe a little independence could be good for them. After all, he was the good-natured one—the model citizen who walked well on a leash, kept his kennel tidy, and had a soft spot for chewing on bones rather than stuffing-filled toys. Meanwhile, Bear’s enthusiasm sometimes turned their adventures into all-out doggy disasters.

One sunny afternoon, after several rounds of heartwarming howls and wild wrestling matches, they finally agreed: “Alright, let’s give each other a chance to shine on our own!” It was a bittersweet decision, but the promise of loving homes was too enticing to ignore.

So, with his tail wagging and heart racing, Benji is ready to strut his stuff for potential adopters.

Meet Benji: 1322 DAYS and Counting with us!
Disposition: True to the Jack Russell temperament
No other animals: Benji needs a home where he is the sole focus.
No children under 10: His environment should be calm and without young kids.
Love for belly rubs and food: Benji enjoys affection and treats.

This boy!! Tobi came to us from a local animal shelter. He was found after being hit by a car and suffering a broken elbow and 4 fractured ribs. He had surgery to splint his leg and kept the splint on several weeks. He will always have a limp but gets around just fine. He didn't slow down one bit through all of this trauma!! He is blind which makes us think he is a senior but has ""good teeth"" as the vet said so age is uncertain. Lab work was good so he has been neutered, is heartworm negative and has a microchip.
He is the funniest little guy, look at his Halloween picture..he had so much fun. The BEST personality..literally everyone who meets him loves him. He is affectionate, active, playful and eager to please.

Meet Resi! Resi is the sweetest 2.5 year old mix! She is 70 lbs and fully grown. This poor girl was adopted from a shelter but did not get along with the kitties in the home. Instead of being returned, a wonderful family stepped up to foster her.

Resi is currently being fostered in Griffin, GA. She goes to doggy daycare weekly and does fantastic with all of the dogs there! She also loves people and everyone she meets! She is a very confident dog with no nervous energy. She is active but also calm and will snuggle right up to you.

Resi is fully vetted- up to date on all shots, spayed and microchipped. She is also heartworm negative. Crate and house trained. This girl is perfect and so deserving of her forever home!"

Charlie appears to be a chihuahua mix, close to 20 pounds. He is super sweet, smiles when he first sees someone approaching him. He is quiet, very affectionate. He does great with other dogs and children. He is estimated to be around 8 years old. He has a grade 3 heart murmur but no symptoms from this currently. His best friend, Izzy, is listed as well..they came in to rescue together ?? They will do fine adopted separately if needed. I can't say enough good about him, great indoors completely potty trained. He loves his outdoor time relaxing in the sun. He is not a good choice for an active home, he prefers quiet snuggles on the couch."

Meet Rosie! Rosie is the momma to our cattle dog puppies we have found homes for and now it is her turn to find a home! She is currently fostered in St.George, South Carolina. We rescued Rosie and her puppies from Polk County Animal Control back on 3/19/2023. Rosie has come a long way and looks like a completely different dog now that she has put on weight after nursing her pups. She was a great momma and has turned into a magnificent dog.

Rosie is a 2 year old pointer/cattle dog mix. We are sure she is mixed with multiple different breeds so these are truly our best guesses. She may even have some beagle and most likely Staffordshire terrier in her. Rosie's markings and coloring are beautiful. She is a very loyal girl who loves to walk right by your side, is quiet and loves leash walks. She listens well and focuses easily.

Rosie is dog friendly and does best with slow intros on the leash. She loves hugs, toys and treats! She is very treat motivated so that makes training even easier! She barks at cats and has not had any one on one contact with them but would probably do best in a cat free home. She has not been around any younger children but she is very gently and we think she would actually do great with them. She is the perfect dog for someone looking for a companion!

Rosie is fully vetted- up to date on all shots, spayed and microchipped. She is heartworm negative. She is current on monthly flea, tick and heartworm prevention. She is available for meet and greets at her fosters farm/home in St.George, South Carolina. She can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to her adoption fee."

Meet Charlotte! Charlotte is a beautiful 2 year old female pit mix. She was a stray found on a playground trying to make friends. We are assuming she was dumped by previous owners just like so many are. Charlotte came into our rescue earlier in the year and had to switch foster homes and we had to wait quite some time to get her in for vetting.

Charlotte is a very loyal girl and craves human attention. She is currently in a foster home with a fenced in backyard and enjoys playing with other male and female dogs her size. She does not do well with cats so we would recommend a home without small dogs as well. She is also great with children. She is very strong and athletic so an active family will be best for her. She is house and crate trained as well.

Charlotte is now fully vetted- up to date on all shots, spayed and microchipped. Charlotte was heartworm positive when she came into our care but has since been treated and is current on monthly flea, tick and heartworm prevention. Charlotte is available locally for meet and greets. She can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to her adoption fee."

***MUST BE ONLY DOG***

Buddy is a long, short boy appears perhaps Beagle mix. He is very friendly with all people and loves attention. He is neutered and all vet care including vaccines, dewormer, heartworm test (negative and prevention started) and microchip insertion have been done. He has been kept outdoors most of his life, but he is doing great inside with his foster. He would make a wonderful family pet!!
He loves toys and playing outside in a fenced yard. He is super affectionate, meets his foster daily with a big stuffed animal in his mouth and tail wagging hard!!
Absolutely not sure why, but he does not do well with other dogs. He has been around several and did great in the beginning at his foster home, but now showing aggression..perhaps jealous? He fathered a litter of pups who are in the foster home as well (away from him of course) but not sure if that had caused issues for him. He deserves a family of his own who will have him as the center of their attention."

Meet Lena! Lena is a 5 year old stafforshire terrier mix. We think she may be mixed with a larger breed like cane corso but are unsure. She’s a large girl with an equally large heart searching for her forever home!

Lena had a very rough start for her first two years and was living on a chain. Since being rescued she is with a foster and is learning how to be an inside dog. She had very little human interaction but she is friendly to people she meets. She would do best as an only pet. She is not good with little dogs or cats. She is crate and house trained.

Lena is fully vetted- up to date on all shots, spayed and microchipped. She is heartworm negative. She is current on flea, tick and heartworm prevention. Lena is available for meet and greets locally with potential adopters."

Meet Luther! Luther is a 4 year old, 70 lb Staffordshire terrier. He has been with our rescue for over almost two years now and we are hopeful he will find his forever home soon! We discovered last year at his current fosters home that Luther is deaf. His previous foster thought he was hard of hearing but we think he cannot hear at all as he doesn’t respond to any loud noises and sleeps through dogs barking.

Although Luther is deaf, deaf dogs really don’t require much extra responsibility! Previous experience is not required. He just has different ways of communication when meeting other dogs and off leash outside of a fenced in area would not be recommended since he can’t hear you if called. Luther is very people friendly! He is also dog friendly but can be selective when it comes to larger male dogs. Because he is deaf, his body communicates in a different way upon meeting other dogs and sometimes he does mount them. He plays great with all the puppies that come and go in his foster home. He would be fine in a home with another dog that he gets along with or would be happy with being an only dog. He had previously been around young and old children. We would recommend no littles as he is solid and could easily knock them over.

Luther is great in the car! He is house and crate trained and has no problem when instructed to go in it. He does walk well on leash as well. He is a super sweet boy, loves playing with toys, treats and getting all the attention. He also LOVES water and will jump right in and go for a swim! He can play catch and then is ready for a snuggle on the couch after. He is a medium energy level.

Luther is up to date on all shots, neutered and micro-chipped. He is heartworm negative. He is current on his monthly flea, tick and heartworm prevention. He is available locally for meet and greets. He can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee."

BEAUTY will be undergoing eye surgery. This sweet, docile 8 month old pup has an eye condition called Entropion. This is a common eye condition in dogs that causes the eyelids to roll inward, resulting in the eyelashes and fur rubbing against the surface of the eye. Entropion is painful for dogs and leads to vision loss if left untreated. Beauty is young, otherwise healthy, so very sweet and loving, and absolutely deserving of a pain-free life and the opportunity for a second chance. She will be available for foster or foster to adopt until she heals from her surgery.

Kiddo is currently with a loving foster family near Ringoes, NJ.

Her foster mom writesHere's Kiddo. She is smart and picked up on the routine. Not completely house trained but with routine, she will get it. She loves playing, going on walks and cuddle time. She lets you know when anyone walks into the house (I told the kids they won't be able to seek out now that she's here- lol).

When she was in GA, Kiddo was the staff favorite! She is so sweet. She is outgoing and loves attention. In GA she enjoyed playing with her friend Kasey but out of the shelter she doesn't seem to be as dog friendly. It could be that she just needs to decompress but we just want to play it on the safe side & say no other dogs and she would be happy with that. She just wants her human to love her!

She is good on a leash but gets the zoomies too!!!

THOR

Thor is an adorable, smaller boy who loves playing and hanging out with his people. He is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

1. I am 2 years old.

2. I am a typical Cane Corso – shy with strangers at first, but friendly and affectionate with my own people.

3. I have done well with children, but I can be quite energetic. Any children I live with should be older than 12 and have experience/training with giant dogs.

4. I have done well when meeting other dogs and would probably enjoy having a female companion. (Note: When introducing any new dogs to resident pets, introductions should be taken slow and be supervised.)

5. I have not been around cats, so I’m not sure how I feel about them.

6. I am especially nervous around men at first and will need time to warm up to any new men. However, once I know them I am friendly and affectionate. I love my adult human foster brother!

7. I am food motivated and quick to learn. I am house-trained, crate trained, leash trained, and am working on basic obedience commands. However, like most young teenagers I can be a bit stubborn sometimes. I would benefit from continued training to help keep me practicing what I already know, to learn fun new things, and to bond with my new family.

8. I have lots of energy and love to do zoomies! My new family will need to be willing to spend time with me and make sure that I get plenty of exercise. I love to go for long walks and have lots of play sessions with my people.

9. The words that best describe me are playful, happy, and confident. My foster says that I am a good-hearted dog and a great companion.

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped.

We highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.

MIMOSA

Mimosa is an ultra-sweet girl who loves everyone and everything! She is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I was listed as being 8 yrs. old by shelter staff, but my foster says that l look and act younger, so my age is really unknown.

2. I am a Bulldog mix.

3. My most favorite thing in the world is snuggling and chilling with my humans. I’m not really interested in long walks, ball chasing, or running the agility course. I’d much prefer a laid back kind of lifestyle.

4. I have gotten along well with every dog I have met. After all, I am a lover and not a fighter!

5. Yes, I like cats!

6. Humans big or small, I love them all!

7. I am easy-going and agreeable.

8. The words that best describe me are snuggly, chill, and laid back.

9. I am currently being fostered in central Virginia, but transport help might be available depending on the location.

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, microchipped, and spayed.

FERGUSON

Ferguson (AKA Fergie) is an adorable bundle of energy and fun! He is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

1. I am about 2 years old and am a Bulldog mix.

2. I came to rescue incredibly skinny and not feeling well at all, but thanks to my awesome foster I am now happy, healthy, and learning how to enjoy being a dog.

3. I love being busy and doing super fun stuff! My favorite toy is my ball. I LOVE my ball! My ideal home would be a very active one with someone who likes to hike, go for walks, play ball with me, and possibly even do dog sports with me. (Did I mention that I love being busy?)

4. I was recently introduced to other dogs and my foster says that I did well when properly introduced with slow introduction practices.

5. Cats? Yuck! No thank you! Cats are big no for me.

6. I think I would be ok with children, but I am very busy and active. So any children would need to be 8 years or older.

7. I need a home with someone who will be willing to continue my training to help me be the best boy that I can be. Training is great fun for me and an excellent way to become my very best friend.

8. The words that best describe me are friendly, affectionate, playful, and energetic.

9. I am currently being fostered in central Virginia, but transport help might be available depending on the location.

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, microchipped, and will be neutered before I go to my new home.

BAMBI

Bambi is a super sweet, beautiful girl! She's the perfect combination of energetic and fun, yet still able to relax and be calm. She is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:?

1. I am about 3 years old and I am a Cane Corso.

2. I am small for my size. When my rescuers found me I was completely emaciated at 50 lbs. I am much healthier now, but I still have some more weight to go to reach my healthy weight, which will probably be about 70 lbs.

3. I am a happy, super playful girl who loves people. However, because of my size and energy, any children I live with should be older than 12 and have experience/training with giant dogs.

4. I enjoy the company of my large male foster siblings, but no small dogs, please. (Note: When introducing any new dogs to resident pets, introductions should be taken slow and be supervised.)

5. I have not been around cats, so I’m not sure how I feel about them.

6. I am a people pleaser and a fast learner. My foster mom says that I am very smart and that I am (mostly – see #7) house-trained, crate trained, doggy door trained, and working on obedience and leash training (I don’t pull or resist, but I still sometimes need to be reminded how to calmly walk in a straight line.)

7. I love people, and am wiggly and affectionate when petted, however, positive physical touch is new to me so sometimes I get nervous and so excited that I accidentally pee. I don’t mean to do it, and I am getting better, but this is something my foster mom is still working on.

8. I have lots of energy and am super happy and fun. I love to play with my toys and my foster fur sibling, but sometimes I can be a bit much for him because I wear him out! I also love to play outside and bathe in the sun. I am a Velcro dog who likes to follow you everywhere and nap at your side. I enjoy long walks, car rides, napping and being with my people.

9. The words that best describe me are friendly, affectionate, Velcro, playful, happy, and sometimes nervous.

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped.

Cool Cleveland is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 11 things about him:

1. I am a Cane Corse around 4 years old and I weigh about 115 pounds.

2. Before I came to rescue, I was taken in as a stray and I was underweight. The shelter wanted to put me down because of my breed and my size, but my foster mom advocated for me and the Bullpen got me out!

3. Even though my previous life was the pits, I am a gentle giant who is very grateful to have been given another chance. I am so thankful for my people and I show that by staying as close to my foster mom as I can get.

4. Like most dogs of my breed, I can be standoffish with strangers. My new owners will need to make sure I have a slow and proper introduction to unfamiliar humans and environments.

5. I generally tend to ignore other dogs, but one time I met a canine that I really didn’t care for, and it did not end well.  Therefore, I think it would be best if I could be the only dog in my new family’s house.

6. I think I would do alright in a home with older children, as long as they had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

7. I haven’t had much experience with cats, but I do live with a rabbit and I’m a little too eager to get close to him. I should probably not live in a home with cats or other small animals, just to be safe.

8. The words that best describe me are athletic, playful, and affectionate.

9. My favorite things to do are playing fetch in the back yard, eating, and going on walks.

10. I am housebroken and wonderful in a crate, and my foster mom even lets me relax out of the crate when she’s gone. I am also great on a leash, I know basic obedience, and I am a super quick learner. I know I could learn so many new tricks and behaviors with training!

11. I am fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped.

Lovely Laurel is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I am a Mastador (short for Mastiff mixed with Labrador). I am about 3 years old and I weigh 100lbs.

2. Before rescue, nobody ever cared about me.  My old owners didn’t even bother to give me a name- they just called me “Girl.”  Then I was surrendered to a shelter in rural South Carolina with 6 of my puppies.  The shelter tried to do the right thing and find us rescue as a family, but every rescue that the shelter contacted either said no, or said they would take my puppies but that they couldn’t help me.  As a result, we all sat there for months and months until finally the Bullpen stepped up and said, “Let the puppies go to another rescue, and we will help the mamma.” Can you believe it? They picked me!!

3. I am a very sweet pup, and I like almost everyone I meet.  I know I would do well in a home with children over 10, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

4. I’m not sure how I feel about other big dogs.  Mostly I ignore them, but I’ve been grumpy with some of the other residents through the fence here.  Maybe if my new home had a large, laid-back male it wouldn’t be too bad, but I also wouldn’t mind being the center of attention!

5. I haven’t had any interaction with small or medium sized dogs at the rescue, so to be on the safe side, it would probably be best if my forever family didn’t have these kinds of pets.

6. My only experience with cats since arriving at the sanctuary is the occasional sighting of a barn cat, so I can’t say for sure if a feline-friendly home is right for me.

7. The words that best describe me are spirited, playful, and affectionate. My favorite thing to do are giving kisses, playing with toys, and napping on my bed.

8. I am housebroken, and I am learning how to walk politely on a leash. I know basic obedience and I’ve already mastered the dog door!

9. I am fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped.

10. I am heartworm positive, but I’ve started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.

Sweet Sparrow is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 11 things about her:

I am a Neapolitan Mastiff and I am about 3 years old.

Before I came to rescue, nobody really cared about me. I was very skinny and sick when I was found wandering around a busy street in North Carolina. The shelter wanted to put me down because of my breed and my poor overall health, but some nice people advocated for me and then asked the Bullpen if I could come to the sanctuary!

Even though my previous life was the pits, I am an extremely sweet girl who is very grateful to have been given another chance. Like most dogs of my breed, I can be slow to warm up to strangers, but once I’ve had the opportunity to get to know you, I am a total lover.

I think I would do well in a home with children over 12, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

When I got to the Bullpen, I had an eye condition called entropion, which caused the heavy wrinkles of my face to push down on my eyelids. This made my eyelashes roll inwards and scratch my eyes, which lead to irritation and vision impairment. Up until recently, I wasn’t healthy enough to have surgery to fix this problem, and that meant that I couldn’t see well enough to have a proper introduction to the other dogs here. Because of this, I can’t say for sure whether a home with large dogs is the best fit for me.

I’m not sure how I feel about dogs under 60lbs, so I honestly don’t know if I can live in a household with these kinds of pets.

I don’t think I care about cats. It’s difficult to say definitively, because it’s possible that I haven’t noticed the barn cats that hang around the sanctuary due to my vision problems, but I might be able to live with a feline-friendly family, as long as I’m allowed to meet my new cat companions very slowly and always under supervision.

The words that best describe me are gentle, mellow, and obedient.

My favorite things to do are taking naps, being around people, and exploring outdoors.

I am housebroken and wonderful in a crate. I am also great on a leash, and I know basic obedience and how to use a dog door!

I am fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. Unfortunately, I am heartworm positive, but I’ve started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.

Howdy, everyone! Dolly here. I’m an outgoing girl who is good with most dogs and people. I was just spayed Oct. 8, and am now UTD on my shots, microchipped, and ready to roll after recovery.

I am a sweet girl about 2 years old and am the “beige version” of my already-adopted sister, Penny (now Cookie).

I am learning to walk on a leash and am really getting the hang of it. Before, I would just lie there like a brick and stare at you. Now I know it means we’re going on adventures! Woohoo!

As with all of the rescues here, I will require a secure, above-ground fenced yard to keep me safe.

Hi, everyone. I’m Katie and I’m a special girl! I am beautiful and happy to be with my favorite people but very independent as far as most human society is concerned. I have come a long way since I arrived here at rescue in 2023. I came from the same backyard breeder as Angel and her puppies (Grace and Blackberry), but luckily I escaped the terrible genetic defect that shortened little Blackberry’s life.

I will probably never be a true cuddle pup, but I’m good with other dogs, I love my porch life and my Dogloo and I definitely enjoy Benebones to the fullest! I’m not a fan of leash walking — and yes, they are working on that with me, but so far I’m “winning.” As you know, there’s stubbornness and then there’s JRT stubborn. ?

When you look in my eyes, you see that I was not given the life I should have had and now that it is available, I sometimes don’t quite believe in it.

I’m about 3 years, old, UTD on my shots, microchipped, and, most importantly, spayed! I will make a great quiet companion … well, unless the delivery truck arrives! I would do best in a house without small children as I have never been around them and they might make me uncomfortable.

As with all of the rescues here, I will need a secure, above-ground fence to keep me safe.

Jude is a very cute and handsome 7 year old neutered male Brittany. He was an owner surrender after having been tethered to a tree for an extended period of time and has a permanent scar around his neck to prove it. It took nearly nine months to be able to safely pet him and another
four months for him to be adoptable. It's unknown if he ever lived in a house, but
surprisingly he is not destructive and does not soil in his room.
After a year of training he has near perfect recall. Leash walking continues to be a
challenge. Jude knows the commands Off! (get off) and Down! (lay down) and Wait!. These
skills will be very helpful for housebreaking in his new home. He loves to play catch and will
catch everything from toys, to treats to medication.
Jude would do best in a home with Brittany experienced adopters with no children. He still likes
to put his mouth on the hands of a person petting him. Although this is a gentle
gesture, it can be frightening to a child. In his past life he barked and lunged at dogs
that came in range of his tether, he now mostly ignores dogs that come in his sight, but
will overwhelm dogs that he comes in physical contact with. In time, Jude may do well
with children and dogs, but he's not there yet.
For Jude's well being, it would be best if his potential adopters met him before
adoption. His current home is in north Georgia, close to Chattanooga, TN. A visit can
be scheduled to see him and experience his mannerisms. He is a wonderful dog who's
earned a second chance at life. With a bit more work, Jude can become a loving
companion.

Jude is being fostered in northwest Georgia. His adoption fee is $350.00 to offset his vetting and to help our other Britttanys in need. He can be transported up to 1400 miles via our Canine Railroad. Adoption applications can be found on our website www.nbran.org. For more information, contact brittsnbits@gmail.com."

Elsa is an energetic 4 year old little female Brittany. She loves to run and play. Elsa will need a home with a secure physical fenced yard. (She is not a candidate for an invisible fence.) She is good with most dogs and enjoys a bit of rough play. Elsa is a leader and will initiate mischief as well as play. She is doing well with obedience training and leash walking although some days she is very stubborn. She is housebroken, independent and does not require lots of affection. Elsa came from a home with children and would be happy living with house full of kids.
She is happiest with another dog to play with, so a home with another dog is best for her. She does not soil in the house and keeps her room clean.
This sweet dog gets vocal when she wants attention and gets louder after she gets it. To stop
this behavior, simply turn away from her until she's quiet, then greet her. She is on Fluoxetine 10mg every other day which helps with her anxiety.

Elsa is being fostered in Georgia. Her adoption fee is $400 to offset the cost of her vetting. She is UTD on her vaccinations, heartworm negative, and microchipped. She can be transported up to 1400 miles via our Canine Railroad with adopters taking the last leg, usually up to 100 miles. For more information, contact brittsnbits@gmail.com."

If there was a smiling contest, I would win! My specialty is being joyful and playful to bring people out of their sadness.
Hi! I'm Remy, a 5-year-old orange and white female Brittany currently being fostered in Northwest Georgia. I have a great sense of humor, love to play games with my foster Mom, go for adventurous car rides or simply relax while chewing a bone while getting lots of belly rubs too.
Now that Autumn is here, I love to zoom around and can easily blend in with the leaves, where no one can find me too. I love to be the center of attention, or the Belle of the Ball you might say, so I will need a Forever home where I can be an ONLY dog as I certainly prefer people over other dogs any day!
Yes, I have a strong prey instinct too! I love chasing things as they buzz by, especially flies, which make great snacks. Because of my strong instincts, my new home will also need to have a physically fenced yard just high enough so that I won't jump over it but will also keep me safe too. As I'm not a jumper, like a kangaroo! I will also need continued training with other things too like walking nicely on a leash, as there are just so many smelly things to check out I sometimes forget its not a race.
I am up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, micro-chipped, and spayed. If you adopt me, you won't be disappointed because I will love you with all my heart too!
If you are interested in giving me, Remy, a Forever home, please consider filling out an adoption application online at: https://nbran.org/adopt/adoption-application, Once your application is received the coordinator in the State where you reside will be in touch to follow-up. Need to reach your State Coordinator, find their contact information here https://nbran.org/about/state-provincial-coordinators
My adoption fee is 350.00 which will help NBRAN cover the vetting costs and other expenses associated with bringing Brit like me, Remy, back to good health and readying them for adoption. Don't live in Northwestern Georgia or close by, No Problem! NBRAN also has a wonderful transport team willing to help bring dogs like me, Remy, to her new family, up to 1400 miles with the adoptive family being responsible for the last 100 miles, at no additional fee. Still have questions? Contact Regional Director Chris Eddinger at ceddinger@verizon.net thank you.

Dreamy Dusk is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

I am a Cane Corso, and I am about 1.5 years old. I am very small for my breed, and will probably never weigh more than 80lbs.

My life before rescue was pretty sad. My owner died and nobody in his family came to take care of me or my dog sister. Sometimes a neighbor would throw food over the fence for us, but we didn’t have any shelter or water for a long time. By the time that animal control came to check on us, we were almost dead.

Despite all of the bad things I went through, I am a super social boy that really likes almost everyone I meet. I think I would do well in a home with children over 12, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

I still have A LOT of puppy energy, and I need an active forever family that will help me channel my high spirits into positive outlets.

I enjoy the company of other large dogs, but I’m not the best at engaging in a calm manner. To be honest, I tend to get over-excited and it can come across as aggressive and rude. If my new family had a large female dog that was very patient, I think it might work, but I also wouldn’t mind being the one-and-only center of attention.

I haven’t had much experience with smaller dogs since coming to the Bullpen, so I’m just not sure that a home with these kinds of pets is right for me.

I am interested in the barn cats that hang around the sanctuary in all the wrong ways, so a feline-free family is the best fit for me.

The words that best describe me are vivacious, playful, and energetic. My favorite things to do are playing with toys and sticks, getting treats, and running around outside.

I am housebroken, and I also know basic obedience and how to use a dog door! I am getting better with my leash skills every day, and I’m not too bad in a crate

I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped.

We highly recommend that our potential adopters fill out an online application as soon as possible, as it greatly expedites the process of finding the right dog for your situation.

Our dogs are available for adoption nationwide but preference is given to adopters willing to do an in-person meeting. Please understand that our dogs are not adopted on a first-come, first-served basis, but rather we strive for a ""perfect placement"" so we know that they will not be failed again."

Delightful Dawn is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I am a Cane Corso, and I am about 2 years old. I am small for my breed, and will probably never weigh more than 90lbs.

2. My life before rescue was very sad. My owner died and nobody in his family came to take care of my dog brother and me. Sometimes a neighbor would throw food over the fence for us, but we didn’t have any shelter or water for a long time. By the time that animal control came to check on us, we were almost dead.

3. Despite all of the bad things I went through, I am a super social girl that really likes almost everyone I meet. I think I would do well in a home with children over 10, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

4. Because I was left in a backyard for so long, I have some abandonment issues. I want to be by your side ALL THE TIME, and will bark or cry when I’m outside alone because I’m afraid you aren’t coming back. My forever family will need to be committed to working with me to build confidence and helping me overcome my previous trauma.

5. I enjoy the company of other large dogs as long as they are on the mellow side. I haven’t had much experience with smaller dogs since coming to the Bullpen, so I’m just not sure that a home with these kinds of pets is right for me.

6. I am interested in the barn cats that hang around the sanctuary, but I am pretty easily redirected. I might be able to live in a house with cats, as long as we were allowed to meet very slowly and always under supervision.

7. The words that best describe me are happy, sweet, and affectionate. My favorite things to do are hanging with my people, snuggling with my humans, and eating.

8. I am housebroken and I am pretty good on a leash. I also know basic obedience and how to use a dog door! I will go in a crate if you tell me to, but I get antsy after a few minutes because I don’t like being away from people for too long. My forever family will need to invest in a heavy duty crate until they are sure that they can leave me unattended in the home.

9. I am fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped.

10. I am heartworm positive, but I’ve started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.

Meet brawny Blake! This handsome hunk is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

1. I am a 4 year old American Bulldog, and I weigh about 100lbs. I need an owner who knows my breed’s characteristics and will work with me to develop my strong points.

2. I had a little training as a service animal before my owner had to bring me to the shelter due to his failing health. I'm not sure how much I remember, but I know that I've got a little knowledge in there somewhere!

3. I've been known to eat things I shouldn't. My new family will need to keep an eye on me when I'm around things like toys and blankets, especially in the beginning.

4. I am generally a social boy with new people and I think I could live in a home with children over 12, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

5. I think I could happily live in a home with a large female dog over 60lbs, as long as we had a slow, proper introduction.

6. I am obsessed with chasing the barn cats at the Bullpen, so a home without cats or small dogs would definitely be the best fit for me.

7. My favorite things to do are being a lounging on my bed, cuddling, and exploring outside in the yard.

8. The words that best describe me are energetic, strong, serious and, silly, and independent.

9. I am housebroken, crate trained, and know how to use a dog door. I also know basic obedience and I am getting better on a leash.

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped.

Chevy is the coolest girl! This sweet lady is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I am about 8 years old and I am an American Bulldog.

2. I am currently being fostered in Carthage, North Carolina.

3. I was very tubby when I came to rescue and have worked hard to shed the pounds! Right now, I weigh a little over 65lbs, and that is a healthy size for me.

4. I am deaf, so I think its best if my new people have had some experience with hearing impaired dogs, or are willing to learn about how best to help me adapt in my forever home.

5. I have foster siblings that are cats and dogs of all sizes. To be totally honest, I really prefer my humans, but I'm pretty sure I could live in a home with almost any other animal as long as we had a slow introduction.

6. I am a happy girl who loves to be part of the family, and I think I would do well in a home with children over 10, as long as they are understanding of my special needs.

7. My favorite things to do are taking naps, going for car rides, and cuddling with my humans.

8. The words that best describe me are calm, easygoing and affectionate.

9. I am housebroken, great on a leash, and I do well in a crate. I am also learning basic obedience at my foster home!

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped.

2. For my breed, I am on the smaller side. I weigh about 85 pounds, and this is a healthy size for me.

3. Since I'm still young, I can get excited easily, but I'm also very good at calming down quickly.

4. I have a foster brother that is a Bullmastiff. He's an old grumpster, and I think I annoy him sometimes with my puppy energy, but we generally get along great. Therefore, I think I could live happily in a home with a larger male dog.

5. I love when I get to meet new people and I think I could live in a home with children over 10, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

6. I‘m not sure how I feel about smaller dogs or cats, but if my new family had these kinds of pets in the home, I might be able to make it work after a slow and proper introduction.

7. My favorite things to do are hanging with my people and playing with toys!

8. The words that best describe me are playful, friendly, and happy.

9. I am housebroken, excellent in a crate, and I'm working on obedience and leash manners. I'm still young, so I'm very eager to learn!

10. I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, spayed, and microchipped.

Meet Rosalita! This lovely lady is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I am a Cane Corso and I am about 7 years old.

2. I am a super social girl that really likes almost everyone I meet.

3. I am currently being fostered in a home that has a male Boerboel and a male American Bulldog, and we all get along splendidly for the most part. I can be a little grumpy with them when it comes to food or toys, but I am easily corrected.

4. I think I would do well in a home with children over 7, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

5. I’ve met lots of big dogs at the Bullpen, and I don’t mind them one bit. I think I would like it if my new home had a male dog over 50lbs for me to pal around with, as long as we were always fed separately!

6. I haven’t had much experience with small dogs since I came to the Bullpen, but I feel like I could warm up to one. There are a couple cats at my foster home, and I generally leave them alone.

7. The words that best describe me are happy, affectionate, and playful.

8. My favorite things to do are hanging with humans, sunbathe in the yard, and getting treats.

9. I am housebroken and crate-trained, and I am good on a leash. I also know basic obedience and how to use a dog door!

10. I am fully vaccinated, spayed, heartworm negative and microchipped.

Meet Spud! This gorgeous guy is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

1. I am a Presa Canario and I am a senior.

2. My life before rescue was pretty awful. I ended up in a shelter in Southern Mississippi with my friend, Patty, and we were almost put to sleep there after nobody claimed us. Luckily The Bullpen stepped up at the last minute, and we made our way to Georgia to start a new chapter!

3. I am a very social boy that is friendly to almost everyone I meet.

4. I tend to be a bit mouthy when I want attention, so I think a home with children older than 10 would be best for me, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

5. I live in a foster home with lots of other dogs and a few cats, and we all get along great. I think I could live in a home with almost any dog over 30lbs, as long as they were friendly.

6. The words that best describe me are affectionate, playful, and mellow. My favorite things to do are playing with toys, taking naps, and hanging with humans.

7. I am polishing my indoor doggy manners, but I still have some room for improvement. I have been known to counter surf and get on the furniture, even though I know better. I also have an odd obsession with water, and my intake has to be monitored ALWAYS. If left to my own devices, I will not stop drinking and that could be very dangerous!

8. I am crate-trained and excellent on a leash. I am working on my housebreaking skills and also learning some basic obedience.

9. I am fully vaccinated, neutered, and microchipped.

10. I am heartworm positive, but I’ve started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.

Meet Patty! This gorgeous girl is looking for her forever family, and wants her new people to know these 10 things about her:

1. I am a Presa Canario and I am about 5 years old.

2. I am a super social girl that really likes almost everyone I meet.

3. My life before rescue was pretty awful. I ended up in a shelter in Southern Mississippi with my friend, Spud, and we were almost put to sleep there after nobody claimed us. Luckily, The Bullpen stepped up at the last minute, and we made our way to Georgia to start a new chapter!

4. I think I would do well in a home with children over 10, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

5. If I go to a home with other dogs, I would like to find a family with a large, laid-back male dog that I could hang out with. I can be a little bossy with other dogs, so an easy-going canine companion would be best. That said, I also wouldn’t mind being the center of attention!

6. I absolutely can NOT live in a home with small dogs, cats, or other little furry creatures. I have a very high prey drive and should not be trusted to be around these kinds of animals.

7. The words that best describe me are confident, affectionate, and happy.

8. My favorite things to do are playing with other dogs, snoozing, and riding in cars.

9. I am crate-trained and perfecting my housebreaking skills every day. As long as I can go straight out to the yard when I get out of my crate, I’m golden! I have also been learning some basic obedience and working on leash training with my foster mom.

10. I am fully vaccinated, spayed, and microchipped. Sadly, I am heartworm positive, but I’ve started treatment, and will come with all the medicine needed to complete it at my new home.

Meet precious Pal! This handsome hunk is looking for his forever family, and wants his new people to know these 10 things about him:

I am a 7 year old Bulldog, and I weigh about 80lbs. Something happened to my tail before I came to rescue that resulted in a permanent kink, which I’ve been told makes me even more adorable!

The past few years have been rough for me. I was adopted and returned 3 times from a shelter in Atlanta before I came to the Bullpen, and I am hopeful that my next family will actually be forever.

Like many dogs of my breed, I can be extremely stubborn and grumpy if I don’t get my way. I absolutely need an experienced owner who knows how to set and maintain clear and consistent boundaries.

I am generally a social boy with new people and I think I could live in a home with children over 14, as long as they weren’t too loud or rambunctious and had some previous experience/training with big dogs.

I think I could happily live in a home with a large female dog.

I love to chase the barn cats at the Bullpen, so I believe a home without cats or small dogs would be the best fit for me.

My favorite things to do are get treats and explore outside in the yard. I also love to go in the car, but I do need to be crated for rides.

The words that best describe me are energetic, stubborn, and curious.

I am housebroken and know how to use a dog door. I am learning basic obedience and am getting better on a leash. I am also crate trained, but I don’t really like to go in.

I am fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered, and microchipped.

Meet Lotto! Lotto has been up for adoption in our rescue since he was approx 3 months old. This boy is so loyal and beyond ready for his forever home. He wants to find his people!

Lotto is a medium sized dog and pretty much fully grown at his current size. He is solid and strong so we recommend an active home for him with children over 10. He is friendly to dogs both big and small but does have prey drive so no cats please. He is house trained, knows basic commands and listens very well!

Meet Hope! Hope’s backstory is one that brings tears to your eyes but we are so happy she is thriving now and ready to find her forever home. We believe she is mixed with Carolina Dog along with other breeds.

Hope was found back in mid February in a trash can at an apartment complex. She was covered in mange and left in horrible condition. We are so thankful she was found by a Good Samaritan.

Hope has been looking for her forever home for months now. She is currently estimated at almost 1.5 years old now. She is people and dog friendly.

Meet Astro!

We rescued Astro as young puppy when we were alerted he was an emergency medical case at the shelter and had no use of his back legs. Despite doing all that we could with better nutrition, water therapy and physical therapy Astro will remain a special needs dog with rear leg paralysis. BUT this does not stop him and he is doing absolutely amazing and really doesn't require much extra care than any other dog.

Astro is everyone's favorite guy. He is so sweet, loving and playful and just truly loves life! He gets around just fine by scooting and doesn't know life any other way so it doesn't bother him whatsoever! He will also talk to you when he needs attention which is just the cutest thing ever.

Astro is 10 months old, a mixed breed dog (parents unknown) and 45 lbs. We believe he is fully grown at this point. He gets along great with other dogs, kids and adults. He has never met a stranger and truly loves every human he meets. His foster mom is working on his potty training and he is doing wonderful but he does wear washable doggy diapers. He loves to snuggle, lay in the sunshine and just be by your side. He recently went camping as well and loved it! He also has a wheelchair which allows him to run in so he can run with all of the dogs!

Emma is good with new people when properly introduced and has been around her foster's 9 year old granddaughter.

Meet Lucas! Lucas has been in search of a forever home since he was 3 months old! He is currently 9/ almost 10 months and is so ready to find a home of his own. Lucas is a boxer/staffordshire terrier mix.

Lucas gets along great with other dogs big and small. He also LOVES kids! Please remember he is young, very playful and full of energy so he could knock little ones over. Lucas has a prey drive outside so it is best he is not in a home with cats.

Lucas loves to snuggle just as much as he loves attention. He follows his foster mom around everywhere, listens very well and is highly treat motivated!

Lucas is looking for a young family who is active. Or he would be a perfect companion to a single person as well. He would make a great addition to pretty much any situation. Sadly he is a black dog and they are overlooked even as handsome as he is. Where are our black dog lovers at?! This boy is great!

Lucas is fully vetted- up to date on all shots, neutered and microchipped. He is current on flea, tick and heartworm prevention. He is available locally for meet and greets. He can also be adopted out of state to approved adopters- a transport fee would apply in addition to his adoption fee."

Meet Lexi! Lexi and her siblings were born on 2/28/2024 at Polk County Animal Control. Luckily a wonderful foster stepped in and volunteered to take them in along with their mom. Lexi is currently 9 months old and wants to be in her forever home already! We believe Lexi is a staffordshire terrier/boxer mix. We do not know what dad is but her mom Laila who is with our rescue looks to be a staffie/boxer mix.

From Lexi's foster mom: ""Lexi is very laid back. She loves attention and will sometimes sit back and watch before she gets into the action. She is a sweetheart who is very smart. I can see her mind working at times"".

Lexi is house and crate trained! She loves people and other dogs. She would be best in a home with children that are 8+ years old given her energy and excitable personality.

Lexi is UTD on all shots, dewormed, neutered and micro-chippped. She is current on flea, tick and heartworm prevention. Her foster is located in Stockbridge GA where is available for meet and greets locally.

Meet Charlie! Charlie is a 2 year old yellow lab mix that we rescued from Clayton County Animal Shelter back in January. Charlie is your typical lab. He is very friendly, energetic and outgoing! He is very loyal and likes to be with you. He is currently fully grown at approx 65 lbs.

Charlie is dog friendly to dogs of all sizes. He is currently fostered with multiple other dogs and gets along with all of them. We would love to see him in a home with another dog as he loves the company. He would make a great hiking/running partner as well. He is good on leash and loves car rides as well. His current foster is working on his crate time tolerance. He has displayed some separation anxiety- we believe he was probably left in one for too long. Frequent checks on him with positive rewards have been helping and we are sure within no time he will build up his crate confidence. Charlie is also great in the house and potty trained.

The only thing we have noticed is Charlie is a little nervous around men. We are assuming he had a previous bad experience with one. BUT with treats, soft talking and patience he warms up quickly!

Cupcake is a very sweet 14 y.o. Chihuahua who was surrendered with her sister Daisy when their owner passed away. There was no family that could take care of them, so we stepped in to save them. We've discovered that she and her sister are independent of each other and rarely, if ever, hang out together. Cupcake is the picture of health, and she had a dental in 2021. She loves to patrol the yard and will come in when called. Cupcake does NOT act like a senior dog. She can never be let off-lead - she likes to follow her nose. When Cupcake first meets someone new, she's a little aloof, but after one day in your home, and she'll be your faithful companion. She enjoys sleeping on a dog bed in the living room, or on her foster mom's bed. She's not much on snuggling close at night, she prefers the foot of the bed. She has a healthy appetite, but needs to stay on a fish/salmon diet so that she doesn't get a rash on her tummy. She loves Purina One Sensitive Skin & Stomach dry food and eats 1/4 cup twice a dayShe could be an only dog, or she gets along great with other dogs. When she met a child at the vet office, she did just fine. Her foster mom says she's perfect for just about any family, except no toddlers please - she's a tiny dog with tiny bones. She looks like a white mini-German Shepherd - she weighs 12 lbs.

Topper was rescued from a South Atlanta animal shelter. She was quite shy the first few days, so we gave her some space and she began to seek us out after about 4 days.

She will come inside when called for her food and bed time, but she really enjoys playing in the yard with her canine friends. She loves her dry kibble and is not a picky eater. She needs to learn to take treats gently though, watch those fingers! When her foster mom is loving on other dogs, she'll yip and tug your pants leg! She wants ALL your love, and we are working to correct that behavior. We only crate Topper when she's eating. However, we do baby gate her when nobody is home. When you pick her up, she'll lay her head on your shoulder and melt your heart instantly. Topper is not suitable for apartment/condo living - she can and will get lonely and bark for extended periods when left alone. She requires a fenced-in yard and a canine companion or two.

Frankie's approximate date of birth is 10/18/16. She has been spayed and fully vetted.
Frankie and her brother, Flint, were found as strays when they were only about 8 weeks old. These Chow/ Shepherd Mix are very sweet dogs but can be a bit timid. They walk great on a leash and you can walk them both easily together, they also enjoy swimming and boat rides and play very well together. It may take some time for them to warm up to you but once they do they will be very loving and loyal companions. We believe they will act very different once inside of their forever homes. With love and care, these two will be shining bright in no time.
Frankie and her brother, Flint are extremely bonded and reliant on one another. They will only be adopted out together, but there is a special adoption fee in place for anyone who meets all adoption requirements, and is willing to adopt the pair.

************************************
We are happy to coordinate a meet & greet for pre-approved adopters. To get started, please submit an adoption application at https://bit.ly/USAHOTNADOPT2024

Adoption process:
Potential adopters complete our online application. From there, we contact them to continue the screening process including checking references, vet checks, and a personal phone interview. Upon completion, potential adopters are pre-approved.

From there, potential adopters are put in touch with the foster parent(s) of the dog they are interested in adopting. If a specific dog is not in mind, admins will make suggestions based on who we feel will be good candidates for their home. We take the foster's opinions into high consideration when determining ideal fit for an adoption.

Once the dog is determined to be a good fit for the adoptive home, the adopter is given advisement on decompression, training, safety gear, and future preventative vetting. The adoption contract is signed and adoption fee paid to finalize the adoption."

Oh my, this sweet guy is so loving. He came in to our hearts as El Jefe, the ""boss"". Pushy he's not unless it's to wanting to give kisses and affection. Oh yummy! He is a social dog and just enjoys being around people. We hope to put a happy ending to the story that brought him to us. Through no fault of his own, Jefe's owners brought him to the clinic to be euthanized. The vet thought Jefe had so much more life to live and love to share. He called and asked could we take him and find him a family who will love him.......the rest of his life. And that's the happy ending we are working on for him.......and we hope you will help. Jefe is happy being a couch potato but if you invite him to go for a walk...yeah...he's on it. Great on a leash. He may dawdle a bit.....that's canine speak for slowing down to check out all the wonderful smells. A great companion with whom everyday life is so much better. Great with other dogs. He lives at the School right now but ideal would be for him to be sharing his love with a family. Jefe is a young 9 year old, vaccinated, heartworm negative, neutered , microchipped and ready to put another bright spot in your every day life."

She came to us as Scout but we think a better fit would be Sunshine or Sunny. She is such a happy, happy dog! With no available fosters, Scout has been living at a day and pet care center. The kennel staff are so fond of Ms Scout. She loves to give kisses and get petted. Scout is particular about the canine company she keeps. Volunteers take her on long walks on golf cart paths that wind through the woods. She's a curious girl, her tail is up and she has this cute prance. She enjoys these walks. Sometimes, she gets to stop and cool her belly in a little stream but often she just starts rolling all over getting coated with dirt and sand....it's a treat to watch her enjoy herself so much. Back from the walk, in a grassy area she plays tug of war and chase and plays army low crawl with her volunteer. She also just loves to sit and watch all the people and dogs coming and going at the center. Play time ends with Scout licking peanut butter off her volunteer's hand.....fun for both. Scout can be quite energetic and as with many other dogs is mouthy when she plays, but is easily redirected. Scout is very smart. She will flourish with someone who understands canine behavior, who loves her, sets boundaries, establishes routines, and plays with her. The best home is where Scout is the only dog and one without children or cats. Scout needs an experienced handler, she is spayed and roughly 9 and a half years old."

Connie is a very sweet and loving dog. She is generally relaxed and easy going; there isn't a comfortable spot she doesn't love. She loves to play and learn new tricks and has recently gratuated from training via Pits n' Pals as well as solving level 2 puzzles.

Her personality is very warm and goofy and naturally curious and is as comfortable running around the yard with a ball as she is on a couch.

She is very food motivated, so training has been easy. She plays well with our other dog and is super friendly with new people. Connie loves walks - you'll like them too after her initial excitement wears off (5 minutes). She is potty and crate trained - she will complain but a peanut butter Kong solves that problem.
She signals when she needs to go out - we've only had one accident at the house and it wasn't her fault. Her favorite thing to do is snuggle.
Connie has met several children at events and a few in our home but I don't think she's suited for small children, given her inquisitive nature and the that likes to give love nibbles sometimes

Connie comes with
-smarts
-cuddles
-a love of all things edible
-Pits n Pals certified training
-social skills
-tricks
-training gear, harness, shots, up to date flea and tick and is spayed"

Gunner is a 45 pound goofy bundle of enthusiasm. He loves belly rubs, riding in the car and walking in the park. At home he is a dog toy tester playing inside and outside with balls, stuff animals, kongs, and bones. He plays well with the other 2 dogs in his foster home and sits for treats. He is incredibly strong and while decent on a leash, needs a little more work.
Gunners tested positive for heartworm but is currently receiving treatment. After 6 months at the Coweta County Animal shelter he was placed on the July euthanasia list, so he will need an understanding owner who can continue to work to make him the best dog.

Sienna is a young lab mix and loving cuddle bug. She enjoys treats, pets, belly rubs, chew toys, and running around in the yard. The veterinarian thinks she is a bit younger than 2 years old and says she's built like an ox! She will walk on leash but is still learning a few leash manners. She needs a firm grip when walking in public.

Her friends at Hearts'n Homes Rescue believe she was not treated very nicely in her previous life. She will surrender ""belly up"" very quickly because of this and is learning to feel safe around new things, young children, and men. However, she really wants to please her people. Sienna settled in quickly to her foster home and loves cuddling on the sofa. She is also housebroken and crate trained. She plays well with other dogs, and has only shown curiosity toward small pets. She has not been tested with cats.

Meet General Lee!

Lee came to us at the beginning of 2023 with a badly broken rear leg which was able to be splinted and healed. Now that he is better, and able to run all of the zoomies that he wants, he is ready for find his forever home!

He is just over 1 year old and has lots of puppy energy to keep you on your toes! He is a smaller sized Boston Terrier/French Bulldog mix. He has had some limited time around a cat and he does well.

However, he is particular about his friends.
He has to get to know you first and he does NOT like men or kids. He can also be dog selective. There are some that he gets along with and some that he does not, so a family where he would not need to go to boarding or day care would be best.

For these reasons, we want Lee to go to a female owner who has experience with dogs and in a SINGLE dog home without kids. He is not best suited to a first time owner since he has some behavior challenges to work through.

General Lee is house trained and crate trained and he rides well in the car.

Meet Anthem!

Anthem is a sweet & docile boy. He loves to play with tennis balls. He gets along with other dogs and would be gentle with kids. He is still working on house training, a fenced in yard would be ideal. He sleeps with his humans through the night.

He is 4 months old and is a mix off????
Mom is a smaller shepherdy looking dog and dad is a bigger lab mix? Both parents look to be mixed with pitties or American Bulldogs (they are the most common bully breed dog to be white) too so we really don't know!

His mom is about 40 pounds and his dad is about 65 pounds. So we think that he will stay in that weight range when full grown.

He is an adorable 10 month old husky mix puppy who has lots of energy! He weighs 44 pounds and is almost full grown.

Firefly is a rambunctious and wild little boy! He loves all the toys, and playing chase and tug-of-war with his foster siblings. He is extremely curious and is always trying to explore new areas of his foster home. He is very smart and is catching onto basic commands quickly. He loves being the center of attention. His baby blue eyes have stolen his foster mom's heart. He is housetrained too!

He is a high energy puppy so his family should be prepared for a go go go adult dog. He is good with other dogs and he LOVES kids. He does have some anxiety from being left alone in a crate alone, but his is coming very far with training and taking reintroduction to his crate very very well! We think that he needs a home with a friend- another dog- and an owner who is home frequently throughout the day. He LOVES to play and run so a fence is a must!

Firefly never meets strangers and is playful and always happy!

PLAY PLAY PLAY! Ginger is a rambunctious, fun-loving dog!

She is a 5 year old long haired Chihuahua mix and she is full grown at 10-11 pounds.
She loves people, other dogs, and food - a little too much! Due to her high energy, Ginger should not be left alone for more than 3-4 hrs at a time on a regular basis as she tends to become destructive due to anxiety/boredom of being alone. Ginger definitely needs mental stimulation throughout the day. Her pawrents will need to be very patient and observant as Ginger is not housebroken. A fenced yard is a must so this girl can get out all of her energy! Ginger is working on her crate training, but she would rather spend all of her time right next to you. Apartment life is not an option for this very vocal girl.
She will need a home with a very patient and playful canine companion, a pupster that will teach her the household rules.
A home with a senior dog would not work well for her because she LOVES to play (and egg them on to play in her special mouthy way), doesn't know when to stop playing, and doesn't know when the other dog is tired. .
She is a velcro girl and will try her very best to be on you - yes, ON you at all times, even if you're just walking about the house.
She does well with older kids and teenagers who understand how to handle and respect small dogs, but she is very mouthy and wouldn't do very well with little kids. Ginger's foster pawrent will have additional notes for serious adopters.

At an about one year old, he is a bundle of sweetness, always ready to roll on his back and get belly rubs (even from strangers)! Winston's goofy and adorable habits will absolutely bring a smile to your face. His favorite trick is to hold the leash and walk himself!

He also never stops wagging his tail while eating his meals. Another endearing quality of Winston is that he loves to always have a toy or blankie in his mouth because he's just too excited to see you! Winston has his energetic and playful moments, but once he gets to play a while he likes to settle down and get pets from his favorite people. He takes treats and hugs with a gentle demeanor. Winston has also been working hard on learning some tricks like sit, wait, and spin!

Adopting Winston would mean gaining a loyal friend who will always be there to provide you comfort and joy on both good and bad days. His gentle nature, soulful eyes, and loving heart are sure to be a wonderful addition to the family!

Winston is good with other dogs and with kids, although he needs to learn some manners around young kids because he can sometimes knock them over when playing. He is crate trained and almost house trained.

She is learning housetraining and she is crate trained. She will need leash training though- a since her home and yard are so big, she and her family have never needed to be on a leash so she will need some patience as she learns.

Meet Dave!

This hunk of love is a 2 and a half year old Chocolate Lab mix. Dave is about 73 lbs. Dave came from the Fayette County Animal Shelter and has LOVED having a foster home now!

He is extremely trainable, he loves treats, and he's super eager to please. He is housebroken, and crate trained.

Dave is so good about telling you what he wants too!

Now for the things Dave loves, in no particular order:
People
Couches (if the people are on it)
Dogs that will play with him
Food
Attention
Chew toys
Oh, and most importantly: Dave believes that Ball is life! If you do not have tennis balls, Dave will insist that you invest in some.

He also loves golf cart rides and going on adventures with his humans. His favorite places to go are places where his humans will shower him with love and attention! He will do just about everything so long as he can be with his people.

He also does well with calm cats after a slow introduction.

His foster mom's dream for Dave, is a forever family with another active dog to play with. He LOVES his foster siblings, and wants to play with them any chance they will allow. He will need a physically strong and energetic owner because of how strong and energetic he is.

He's Fantastic on a leash (most of the time) but he can pull if something (like a dog he wants to play with) gets his attention. Dave would also do best with dog savvy older children because of his size, strength, and athleticism.

Dave has some selective reactivity, that is getting much better as he gets more comfortable and confident in his environment, So, please understand that he may take some time to get used to you or your family, and he will need to continue being socialized regularly. Because of his reactivity, and strength, he would be best in a home with older/larger children, or a home with no kids at all.

If you believe you and Dave are right for each other, go ahead and fill out an application. He would love to meet you!

Corona has been around lots of other dogs and around lots of kids and she has does great with everyone!
She is a big baby doll!! She doesn't seem to be affected by her foster family's cats when they come near, but there hasn't been a formal introduction. She plays hard with her big foster brothers but loves even harder. She will do wonderful with younger kids and other dogs.
This silly girl is house trained and fully crate trained. She is learning to come and sit and is very food motivated so she will probably be easy to train with some one on one training.

Gunnar is FUN FUN FUN! He is a 1 year old Siberian Husky mix who has never met a stranger. He weighs 48 pounds and is pretty much full grown. He is playful and friendly with everyone- he loves kids, other dogs, and playing all day!! However, he does love to chase cats.

He loves to go on car rides and get pup cups and to snuggle up on the couch to watch TV. Or to take a nap in bed with you. He is a high energy boy though when he is up, but he really just wants to hang out with you. Meaning that after a run around the yard, he is happy to watch tv in bed with you and observe things through the window. Gunnar is a fantastic travel companion, and he loves to sit in the passenger seat of the car and people watch. He would make an amazing hiking companion.

Gunnar is crate trained and house trained. He is a rambunctious boy and he does need some manners around little kids- he has no idea how much he weighs and will jump right into you. For an adult, this is manageable. Gunnar would do best with an owner who is use to training and setting boundaries with a puppy and kids who are not going to be afraid of a puppy who is learning how to be a respectful family member.

He is WONDERFUL and is a volunteer favorite at adoptions. He knows ""sit"" and is working on ""down"". Gunnar is super smart and just needs someone to spend time with him. He loves to cuddle and to spend time with people. He is AWESOME with other dogs and has LOTS of four legged friends and he makes new friends everywhere he goes!

Miller has been around lots of kids and other dogs and does great with kids and adults! He enjoys playing with the other dogs in his foster home. We also think that he will do well with cats after an introduction.

Sammie says I'm ready to be adopted!!

Beautiful Sammie is a 2 year old German Shepherd. She is a nice 55lbs.

Sammie was saved by a good samaritan when her life was in danger. Sammie has lived a lot of her life outside. Her teeth are worn from being on a chain. Even though humans have repeatedly failed her she is the best family dog! She adores her human foster brothers and their friends. She is so snuggly and playful. Sammie loves to ""talk and her antics will keep you laughing. Her coat is ever so soft but will need proper grooming to keep it from matting. Sammie has many furry foster siblings and does well with them. She is very vocal and quirky with her play so a submissive friend would be best. Sammie absolutely adores her toys and super chewers. She loves to surround herself in them and often tosses her toys in the air just in pure joy.

Sammie walks well on a leash, is potty trained through the dog door and loves to go for car rides. She will require a good size fenced yard she loves to chase! Sammie also does well in her crate for shorter periods of time.

Could Sammie be the dog for you?

Meet Liam!

He is an energetic, 4 and a half year old Pointer mix who is looking for a forever home. He would make anyone a great hiking or running companion (his foster mom jogs 8 miles a day with him!).

Liam is GREAT with kids and cats! However, he is dog selective. He does great in his foster home with her older, laid back dog, but he is not all about that puppy energy. He likes to do his own thing with his family and doesn't want to be bothered with other dogs.

He currently shares his home with two blind cats, an older dog, and teenagers and he LOVES all little kids that he meets!

Sweet, shy, special Lizza...
this wonderful 3-year-old border collie is from working lines. She is shy and timid at first, and needs to go to a home where patients is a must! She also needs at least one other dog in the home to help get her comfortable.

She loves people and kids, but again needs to be given appropriate time to acclimate to her new surroundings. She will play with toys. She enjoys the company of other dogs and she likes to go for walks. It may take her some time to get used to new surroundings but when she does she brightens right up! A home with older kids over eight would be best or with only adults. She is crate trained and housebroken. An ideal home for her would be one that gives her plenty of time and love and patience to acclimate appropriately, but also one that isn't going to coddle her and help her gain confidence in a new environment. She is not a typical active border collie, but does require some mental and physical stimulation throughout her day.

Lizza is two and a half years old and is full grown at 36 pounds.

Help us find Stuart a perfect home! He is a 1 and a half year old Chihuahua mix who will need a VERY special forever home!

Stuart comes from a family of feral chihuahua mixes. So his interactions with people has mostly been ""humans feed me. And that's it. He was able to be trapped in a dog pen outside with his sister back in mid August and he has slowly been introduced to pets and being held. He has been learning how good people are in his foster home, but he really only cares about one person at a time. He is becoming more and more snuggly with his foster and is super curious of kids, but he prefers to stay out of arms reach. He will snuggle at night with his human family and he loves to take treats from them, but humans are scary when standing up and walking around. He just isn't sure what we will do! When his person is sitting down, he is learning to come up to her lap or to lay at her feet.

Oh and he LOVES daily walks! He waits (not so patiently) for her to hook his leash to his collar. Then he's off and ready to go!

He will need a forever family who is very patient and understands that he will probably always be wary of strangers and will probably be a ""one family only type of dog.
He will need a yard which is securely fenced in for a dog his size (he weighs about 20 pounds). And Stuart will need a doggy companion in his home to learn from. We have found that this is the best way to teach a human skittish dog that people are good and they also help with housetraining. He loves his crate and goes in it when he needs somewhere safe to go. He also loves resting on the couch and running around with his doggy friends.

Does Stuart sound like he right little guy for you? Can you give Stuart the perfect forever home?

He's now fully crate-trained, making him a well-behaved addition to any family. He is ""98% potty-trained"", only having a few accidents here and there. He sleeps through the night without any issues at all. His favorite things to do are play with a tennis ball in the backyard, sleep and snuggle with his foster sisters in a sunbeam, and chew on toys. We are working on sharpening up his leash skills, as he is still trying to learn how to walk on leash. He's respectful of play boundaries with other dogs and loves playing fetch in the backyard.

Flash has been with me for quite some time and I hate to let her go because I have fallen in love with her. She was abandoned by her owners and left with a chain around her neck so tight that it had to be cut off. Her partner in crime is Fred. They are a bonded pair and must go together. She is crate trained. During the day she and Fred share an outside kennel. They have lots of energy. So a big fenced back yard would be ideal. She is spayed and ready for her forever home. Please take her into your heart.

Lady Bird is such a sweet baby. Full of energy. Loves to give kisses. She gets along great with MALE dogs only. Pulled from the shelter pregnant. She had 3 very large puppies which almost killed her giving birth. Only two survived. She has that JRT attitude, but the Beagle bark. She is crate trained. Lady bird will NOT do well with children. She is independant and relishes being left alone until she wants a hug. She is food agressive. And could be a biter. If you have the time to work with her, she will make a great companion.

Turner has visited a BHRG vet for a complete check up and is ready for adoption. He's a tri-colored boy who is around 4 years old and gets along with kids and other dogs. He rides well in a car, and enjoys walks although he does pull a bit on the leash. Turner is sweet and loving, but he can be a stinker at times and get into things that he shouldn't. Ziplock bags fascinate him, and he will get anything within reach like a loaf of bread, etc. But you can't get mad at him because he is so sweet. He is a good sleeper during the day, and he sleeps in his crate at night. Turner is dealing with skin allergies and is eating special food and taking medication. He will most likely always have skin/allergy issues, but the vet is helping him be as comfortable as possible. Turner is dog door trained and crate trained.

Lovely Lulu

Lulu or Louise as her foster mom calls her, is a German Shepherd Dog (GSD) and LOVES her person! She is full grown, is about 7 years old, and weighs about 55 pounds. Lulu is big, but has shorter legs than normal so she is not very tall she also has a cute bobbed tail!
She came to us pregnant and raised a beautiful litter of 7 babies, many of which she still loves to visit with in the area. She was a WONDERFUL momma!

Lulu loves to play with her furry foster brother, take long pack walks with her foster siblings and chase squirrels in the back yard. Having a home with a playful male doggy friend would be ideal for her. Lulu loves her foster mom and would prefer a female owner since guys are so big and scary. She is good with dog savvy teenagers. She does require and fenced in yard as she can be a little nervous around strangers and will take some time to warm up.
Lulu is housebroken and loves to spend her nights either in bed with her person or on a comfy couch.

Lulu is so sweet but is not good with yappy dogs or cats, she likes to chase them! Also Lulu is not good with small children their running about makes her nervous.

I can be a bit of a moody dog and do not like to be bothered when I am resting or sleeping. I do have a loud houndy bark that I use to show my displeasure with things that are not going my way or that are scary to me. I can also be over reactive to things that are not going my way.

A little note from his foster mom: 'Elvis may be the King come back in puppy form. He has so much energy and has all the burning love to give! Elvis loves to give kisses and a nibble here and there. There is pretty much nothing he won't do for a snack, or a peanut butter and banana sandwich. Elvis enjoys walking on the leash and while he fought with it his first time out, he learned quickly that the leash means sniffs and good times. Elvis just wants to be the center of attention for sure, and the spotlight should definitely be on him'

We're not going to lie. Rescue sometimes breaks your heart. We cried when Jag came back to us, because we know how much she wants to be in a home with every fiber of her wigglebottom being.

She had to return to PAWS because her adopters were having some personal challenges that had nothing to do with Jag. They loved her and said she was a dream.

We always take our dogs back, and we always believe we can find them a better fit.

But, Jag is struggling. When you stop by to see her, she wraps her little body into yours and then just collapses into a ball at your feet. Just thinking about how lost she must feel just guts us.

This is the second time Jag has had to come back to us, and both returns had nothing to do with her or anything she did. The first time, her adoptive family had growing teens who ""outgrew"" the novelty of having and dog and no longer felt they had time for her.

Jag adores people and can not get you close enough. If she could zip herself inside your winter coat, she'd do it in a heartbeat. She's a dream in a house and just wants to love and be loved.

Jag walks politely on leash and has a sweet, endearing little smile. She knows her basic skills. She's housetrained and is much-loved around PAWS. She needs to be an only dog, and we are not sure about cats, although she lived in the kitchen of our cat cottage for months with no issues with anyone, cats or dogs."

Dave is a loyal, very good, somewhat anxious guy looking for a quieter, adult-only home, where he can have a predictable daily routine. He loved their kids, and has spent the last 5 months in a home with children ages 5 to 13. But, because of his unpredictability with children at times, his adopters made the really difficult decision to bring him back to PAWS to allow us a to find him a better fit in a home without kids.

At 3, he is smart and playful and walks beautifully on leash. His best fit would be an experienced adopt who is open to working with Dave and helping him feel more confident. Because of his anxiety, he is not a good fit for children. He would feel happiest in a calm, relaxed home with someone who is more of a homebody, who wants a companion."

Caboose is as fun as he is beautiful. His favorite things are plush toys and playtime, and treats are probably a close third on the leaderboard. He’s a master of fetch and will play all day, if you’re up for it.

At 3, Caboose is playful and athletic, but he also has a really laidback energy, meaning that he is up for anything but is never too much. He knows how to read the room and adjust his approach.

We've had a lot of abandoned pets this year, closing in on 150, and Caboose is one of them. He came in so shy and frightened, but was nothing but friendly and polite with our team, as if he sensed he was in a safe place. Since his arrival, Caboose has grown more comfortable and confident.

We'd love to see him end up with someone who is as devoted to him as he will be to them. We'd love to find him someone who can offer him nothing but love and stability and the life he deserves.

We have not yet had a chance to test Caboose with our other dogs or cats. If you would like to meet this gorgeous, easygoing boy, please fill out and send in an adoption application. We'll get you scheduled to come out as soon as possible."

Ms. Dottie is delightful. Short and stocky, low enough to the ground that the grass can almost reach her round little belly, she is a magical dog. She reminds us of a cross between a kimodo dragon and a cupcake— snorty and a little nicked up on the outside, all mushy, gooey sweetness on the inside.

Ms. Dottie came to us from another rescue, where she was saved from a hardscrabble existence, tied to a tree for the first 7 or 8 years of her life. The rescue reached out to us because Ms. Dottie was safe with them, but being overlooked by adopters, and she was heartworm positive. Could we bring her to you, they asked? We took one look at her little crooked smile and said YES YES YES.

Miss Dottie’s first 8 years may have been tough, but this butterfly is ready for the sweet life. She passed her cat test and does not seem flustered by other dogs she see out and about on her shelter walks.

We introduced her to several, and she wasn’t quite sure what to do. When the other dogs got too close, or tried to get up in her grill (as doggos are wont to do), she seemed overwhelmed and wanted her space back. So, we think Miss Dottie would be most comfortable is a home where she can see other dogs at a distance but doesn’t have to get up close and personal with them.

Miss Dottie would love a foster home, or a foster-to-adopt situation, while she goes through her heartworm treatment. She’s a great listener and a true friend.
We think she’d be a good fit for a family, and nothing would delight her more.

If we can answer any questions about Miss Dottie, please reach out. If you’d like to meet her, please put in a foster or adoption application and we’ll make it happen!"

At 1, Piggy just joined our program, and she’s social and adores being the center of attention. She’s a small/medium pibble girl, somewhere between “pocket” and typical size and she is ridiculously pretty in person.
Piggy loves to play and is constantly checking in with you to make sure you’re having a good time. She’s polite that way. We’ve discovered Piggy is not a fan of seeing other dogs out and about at the shelter. So, right now, we’re recommending her as an only dog. She could go to a home with older children or adults. She enjoys walking on leash and has good manners. Piggy is also very intelligent and eager to learn new things. She a very happy, upbeat girl and would love to go on hiking adventures or car rides. She’s active enough to be able to keep up with a physically fit owner, but she also really enjoys the couch-potato life, too. Treats are much appreciated.

Ripley, 2, is a staff and volunteer favorite who is looking for a soft place to land. He is a sweet, easy charmer and a quirky, lovable companion. When we first met him, Ripley was really shy. But he quickly assessed the situation and realized he was among friends and could relax with us. Since then, he's been a joyful guest who makes friends easily.

Ripley has lived in a home and appears house trained and well-mannered. He knows his basic skills and will show them off in return for a tiny treat or two, which he receives like the proper gentleman he is.

His best fit would be an active home, because he's young and fit and loves exercise. He would thrive with a couple of good walks every day, where he could get out and explore with you. Ripley came back to us with a few extra pounds of padding. But, he’s open to walks and hiking and whatever else you want to do, and we think he will easily get himself back in great shape once he’s getting regular exercise.

He's very loyal and loves his human friends and caretakers at the shelter."

Ma’am is soaking up the world like a sponge. She’s learning all kinds of things — how to meet new people, how to walk on leash, plus the excellent sit-stay you can see in this photo. Impressive, right?

Ma’am came to us when her previous human was no longer able to take care of her. It’s taken her a minute to catch her breath and adjust to the shelter, but she’s making steady progress. With us, her body language is wiggly and loose and she is friendly and playful. Her energy is about an 8/10, which is completely normal for a puppy her age.

Ma’am would be a good fit for someone willing to put in the time to help her thrive and learn. She’s smart and she’s loyal. She’s also a tiny bit of a show off. With a little bit of praise and some consistent coaching, she is going to be a great dog. If you’re open to taking a training class together, we know she’d love something like that.

Ma’am is working on greeting new people politely and not jumping up for attention. But, it’s hard, because PEOPLE ARE EXCITING! She grasps the concept of polite hellos, but she’s still working on the execution. :) But, we’re getting there! As she’s a work in progress, we think Ma’am needs an adult home with someone who will continue to work with her to help her develop and grow. The payoff is that you will be able to spend your life with a beautiful, curious, faithful friend.

Charlotte is our free spirit, our wild child, slightly naughty, a tad mischievous and 100% her own lady. She has a big personality and zero social skills training. Being in a shelter, she missed all the basics: Proper Hello Etiquette 101, that seminar on leisurely leash-walking, all of it. She missed all of it.

But, here’s the thing, friend. Charlotte is the smartest girl in the shelter. Give her some time, teach her some basics, and this girl will amaze you. She just needs someone who can show her the ropes of what it means to be a great dog, and then she’ll take it from there. Charlotte already knows sit, stay and wait. She’s never met a treat she didn’t like. So, you could use lots of praise and little bits of cheese to teach her everything she needs to know.

Charlotte loves exercise of any kind, playtime, being with her people and naps. She loves learning and being praised for how smart she is. She loves going on adventures and taking walks. She loves being outdoors and feeling the sun on her face. She loves snacks and chew toys and biscuits. She loves belly rubs and ear scratches, which she calls “scritches,” as in, “Gimme some scritches, please.”

The one thing Charlotte doesn’t love is other dogs. In fact, she’s a hot mess around them. We don’t know why — and we wish we could just sit on the front stoop and have a beer and talk about it. So, if you can be happy with one dog with a boatload of personality, and hanging out at dog parks isn’t really your thing, Charlotte is your girl."

Daisy was rescued by some Good Samaritans, who asked PAWS Atlanta for help with finding her a lasting home. She is deaf and is smart and eager to learn new skills. She loves treats and pets.

Daisy needs to be the only dog in her home. Although she seems okay with seeing other dogs walking off in the distance at the shelter, she does not want them close to her.

Daisy would be a really good fit for someone who is relaxed and friendly. She's not too active, although she does enjoy playing games and going for walks. If you would like to meet Daisy, send is an adoption application and we'll make it happen!"

Hot Chocolate is a typical teenager—no longer a child but lacking the social graces of adulthood. He’s energetic, goofy, and dramatically affectionate when you least expect it, such as when you’re tying your laces and find Hot Chocolate’s slobbering face blocking sight of your shoe. Hot Chocolate loves playing with other dogs. The more muddy the romp, the better. Typical of his breed, he’s also extremely smart. He’s quick to shake paws for a proffered treat, although his execution is a little wobbly. With some structure, a little training, and lavish amounts of love, Hot Chocolate will rapidly transform into a solid, loyal, devoted companion."

We spend a lot of time talking with her about the weather or our week or the obvious fact she is the best good girl. Brandy has been waiting years for a home, largely because she needs the right fit. And adult home with a strong routine would be optimal. She loves playing fetch and is excellent at it. Brandy is a tripod, but she has no idea she has any limitations, so please, please don't tell her she is any different from any other playful, graceful, athletic dog.

Okay, we said, opening the door and fumbling to get the sliplead over his almighty ears. That's when he slipped right by us and took off around kennels of the big dog room! We ran into the small dog room, and then the feeding room. Look at you chasing me, Zoomer laughed. We are having a PAWS Atlanta Adventure! Okay, it was a mercifully short adventure and we got him back on leash with only minor huffing and puffy on our part. But, that's how Zoomer lives his life, full-throttle and ready for the next big thing. At 2, he's part pirate, part dingus and 100% happy, all the time, no matter what life throws at him. He loves people and seemed pretty oblivious to all of the dogs who were egging him on during his great escape. We've not had a chance to test him in play sessions with other dogs or in our Cat Cottage. We're gonna go out on a limb and say he's probably a little too overly enthusiastic about cats. Zoomer is going through heart worm treatment. So, he's technically supposed to be taking things easy for the next few months. Someone needs to tell him that. He would be a perfect fit for someone on the more active side, who wants a big dog with a huge personality. We're working on his social decorum skill set.

Flip Flop is a 1-year old dingus who is looking for an active adult home. He’s very keyed up at the shelter, so it’s hard for him to settle down and nail his first impressions. He’s a sweet kiddo and has done well outside the shelter in his foster home. His foster writes:
He is SUCH a sweet and curious boy, wanting to be anywhere we are in the house. There isn’t a mean bone in his body. He loves to snuggle and isn’t shy about laying on top of us when given the chance! Flip Flop loves toys of all kinds- chews, plush, balls, challenge toys and he will entertain himself with toys or respond well to being played with. We limited toys out in the house to 2 as he likes to collect them for himself. He likes to playfully growl and play tug of war. Flip Flop does fine being bathed in an enclosed space as he will try to get out otherwise, and he loves running around in the yard.
He does sometimes nibble on various items (blankets, pillows) but responds easily to redirects to dog-approved items. Other than the first day at our house, Flip Flop has only gone potty outside and even has rung the bells on the door a few times to indicate going outside. He sleeps through the night in his crate without any problems at all and barks in the morning when ready to wake up! He has taken to the crate really well if needed when being left alone- No destructive behavior noted at all. He is not well leash trained and pulls heavily on a leash, but Gentle Leader head collar training is starting, as he responded well (other than trying to get it off :)) when we practiced it with our current dog’s Gentle Leader.
He follows commands for sit, lay down, and no and usually responds to his name. He does not respond to come, down/off. “"

Legend is a sweetheart who enjoys playing with his foster mates. His birthday is estimated to be around August 2022.

Written by a volunteer at an adoption event: ""I was sitting in the pen at our Bullywags Petco event, playing with my cuddly, blue-eyed Rescue baby Angel, when I saw that we were being watched sadly, from the next pen, by my Rescue friend Legend, and I could see his cute pink nose and ears that were cut off by a sick thug's knife, and I felt guilty, so I brought Legend into the pen, too. Side by side, both white pups tried to climb in to my lap but bonked heads and then stopped and looked at each other. Were they gonna fight each other, jealous about sharing my lap? Instead, their tails suddenly wagged and they playfully wrestled each other like the happy pups that they are, rolling and wiggling over and around me, making me laugh at their antics.""

BullyWag is foster based. We hold weekly adoptions every Saturday from 1-4p at the Petco in Peachtree City, GA. Not all dogs come every weekeend. Please email

Mickey is a big lovable pup. He was adopted from us as a small puppy and due to no fault of his own is back with us looking for his forever home.

He looks to be a Shepherd mix (maybe some Mastiff in there?), weighs 80lbs and is about 15 months old.

He listens well and knows basic commands, house trained and walks well on a leash and LOVES attention. He thinks he is a lap pup. :)

A fenced in yard is required for adoption so he may get proper exercise. He is a strong boy and sometimes thinks he is still a puppy.

Mickey gets along best with the lady dogs or dogs that are not dominant. We suggest he meet any potential fur siblings in person.

Chyna was rescued from a very bad hoarding situation. She was recently adopted and returned due to NO fault of her own. She is a great dog!!

She is a beautiful Shepherd mix is almost a year old and weighs about 50lbs.

Chyna is extremely smart and always wanting to be with you getting attention and love. She still has a lot of puppy energy and loves to play!

She is great with children, other dogs and cats.
She would do best in a home with a fenced in yard (no exceptions) as she likes to run and explore and a home with other dogs would be ideal.

Due to her past bad experiences we will be selective with her new home to ensure it will be her forever home where she will be taken care of. She came back with a bit of anxiety from neglect to where she will need someone that can spend time with her.

Big Al arrived at the rescue with three of his best puppy friends just in time for college football season! On the first weekend our favorite SEC teams took the field once again, our newest friends settled into their foster home with the sounds of Gameday playing in the background.

Needless to say, Big Al was named in honor of Alabama football. True to his (elephant) namesake, Big Al is a sweet and laidback little dude. He even has the ears to match.

Big Al is just around 4-months-old and so cute it hurts. Your guess is as good as ours when it comes to his mix of breeds, but we do know that his long and large feet most resemble those of a greyhound or whippet. At the end of the day, all we can confidently say is that Big Al is 100% good boy—and that’s good enough for us!

She’s also a big fan of other pups and would spend 23 hours of the day outside playing with her fur-friends if we let her.

Louise is happiest when YOU’RE happiest, which means she’s just as good at listening as she is giving kisses. She’s crate-trained, house-trained, and super smart. Just make sure she gets burns off some of that energy first!

It’s impossible not to be happy around Louise—she is a ray of sunshine and so full of life. We pinky promise she’ll keep you laughing with her goofy antics and giant smile.

Don’t just take our word for it, though. Apply to meet Louise today and come see for yourself!


(Louise is spayed, fully vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm negative, microchipped, and more than ready for her fresh start!)"

Thelma (and her sister, Louise) arrived at our local animal control when their owner was arrested on animal abuse charges. Throughout the over two months she spent waiting in the shelter for the police hold to end, she never lost that giant smile. We pulled both girls just as soon as we could, and her smile has only gotten bigger since.

Despite her rough start, Thelma is still the happiest girl on the planet. She loves humans of all shapes and sizes (and always has a big ol’ kiss ready and waiting for anyone who gets close enough). She is dog-friendly and loves to be out on the play field with her fur-friends, but we ultimately think she’d be happiest with another relatively calm dog who likes to nap as much as she does.

Thelma enjoys sunbathing, belly rubs, long walks, and giving just as much love as she receives. With her sweet and friendly nature, medium energy level, and endless loyalty, she makes the 10/10 perfect family dog—all she needs now is the family!

If your home is ready for another (four-legged) resident that is both impossibly cute and impossibly sweet, Thelma is your girl. She is spayed, fully vaccinated, dewormed, heartworm negative, and microchipped in addition to being crate-trained and house-trained. Please apply to meet her today and give her the family that she so deserves."

Miss Molly was found as a stray after recently giving birth. Her litter was, heartbreakingly, never able to be located. After all of that trauma, it is incredible that this sweet girl still loves with her whole entire heart.

This house hippo is 50% adventure, 50% couch potato and is down for whatever just as long as she's by your side. She loves everyone she meets and has a list of best friends a mile long.

She is a quick learner and has her basic commands down. She's also highly food-motivated, which makes training a breeze.

Miss Molly is spayed, fully vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and heartworm negative. Most importantly, she would love nothing more than a couch to cuddle on and a home to call her very own."

When we received a plea for help for Sky (and his brother Petey), we couldn’t say no. His owner had started treatment for a brain tumor and was no longer physically able to care for them. Both boys were rescued several years ago and were loved fiercely; we are happy to be their safe haven until the right adopters come along.

Sky is a 7-year-old male border collie mix weighing in at ~80 lbs.

He knows basic commands, loves the outdoors, and is sweet as can be. He aims to please and thrives on the farm. He is just as smart as he is handsome.

One of Sky's back legs is shorter than the others (possibly due to an injury he suffered as a puppy), but we think that just gives him character. We have updated his vetting and he is now neutered, fully vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and heartworm negative.

Sky and Petey are not bonded and can (happily) be adopted separately."

PERSONALITY: Hi, I’m Gaia and I’m basically a Beyoncé song—independent, smart, and LOYAL. My foster humans also say I’m gentle and kind, traits I perfected during those early days of motherhood. (My puppies all found their forever homes months ago, but I’m still searching for my own happily ever after. Thankfully, I’m so easygoing that it doesn't hurt my feelings.)

SOCIAL SKILLS: I’m a big fan of other dogs who can match my vibe but am equally happy on my own. No cats, please. (Litter boxes? Really? Gross.)

DREAM HOME: I’m not picky, but if I could only put one thing on my “must have” list, it would be a backyard for zoomies and naps in the sunshine. I def wouldn’t complain if there was a comfy couch I just happened to be allowed on.

FAVE ACTIVITIES: Sunbathing, people-watching, long walks, and cuddling (especially cuddling)

TRAINING NEEDS: I’m crate-trained and will hop right in on command, so you don’t have to worry about coming home to any surprise art projects. Although I’m strong (again… independent woman), I’ve been working hard on my leash skills just to impress you. With a patient teacher and some extra snacks, I know I can master anything you throw my way.

THE FINE PRINT: I’m 2ish-years-old and most likely a boxer/staffy mix. Hello, have you seen my gorgeous brindle coat? I’m spayed, fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, microchipped, and receive my monthly preventatives like clockwork."

Benny is a 1-year-old Bull Terrier mix with a heart of gold and a passion for cozy naps and outdoor adventures! He's the ultimate travel and life companion, making him the perfect dog for families that love to play and go outdoors (as long as it doesn't involve water!)

He likes belly scratches, butt scratches, long walks, and other dogs (sometimes a little too much). He loves to play all day since he has a ton of energy, all types of food, he loves people, and being out in the sun. Big fan of Whitney Houston / Female artists and random bushes (see pictures).

He does not like cones but he can tolerate them, celery, and water in most forms - showers, pools, beaches. He doesn't like being ignored too long, and has a tad bit of separation anxiety at times.

Meet Slinky, the sweetest 8-month-old pup (os of 10/17/24) who's full of potential and love! Slinky is already well on her way to becoming a perfectly trained companion. She’s eager to please, picking up commands quickly—she knows how to sit until released, wait before exiting her crate, come inside on command, and even leave her food bowl untouched until given the okay. Though she’s still learning ""down,"" her progress is impressive, and her determination is evident.

Slinky’s name comes from her adorable habit of ""slinking"" through the dog door when she was first introduced to it. After seeing her foster sibling use it, she caught on quickly and now breezes through with ease!

This playful girl loves toys and enjoys a good game of tug with other dogs or fetching a ball (with her own playful twist). She’s extremely food-motivated, which makes training a breeze, but her desire to make her humans happy is just as strong.

Slinky does well in the car, even with other dogs, though her rides have been short so far. She also has a gentle, curious side—she'll bound after squirrels and cats but doesn't seem determined to catch them. She loves being around people and is a loyal companion who follows her foster around and sleeps next to them at night.

While crate training is still a work in progress, Slinky is getting more comfortable with it, especially when high-value treats or meals are involved. With access to a dog door, she’s fully house-trained and has no accidents. Having another dog around helps keep her happy and engaged, especially when her foster is away.

Slinky is working on her leash manners and hasn’t been around kids yet, but with her sweet and eager-to-learn personality, she’ll make a wonderful addition to any home. If you're looking for a super cute, loyal pup who's full of love and potential, Slinky is ready to find her forever home!

Joy is exactly that, a joy to be around!!

Joy's story was a very sad one:(. The first 8 months of her life she lived in a crate. Her owners left her in the crate and starved her, then dumped her in the middle of the street one night, in her crate. She was nothing but bones, the most heartbreaking thing you could imagine. A man on the way home from work picked her up and called WUWF, and we took her in immediately.

After everything she was put through, she is one of the sweetest, most loving dogs we have ever met. Full of love and happy all the time!

Joy LOVES everyone!! She is good with other dogs and kids. She is also good on a leash and crate trained, though after what she went through, we refuse to put her in one again!

Introducing Zoro!

This sweet little guy is just around 5 months and weighs in at about 30 pounds.

Housebreaking, Crate-Training, and Commands

Right now, Zoro is learning both house and crate training.

He sleeps through the night but because he’s still got a puppy bladder, he has some accidents if he can’t hold it any longer -- but make no mistake, he is absolutely learning that outside means potty!

Similarly, he’s learning that a crate is the place to BE! He needs a little bit of encouragement to go in (because the party is outside of it, obviously!) and does whine a little when he first goes in. But otherwise, he sleeps through the night!


Behavior around other Dogs, Cats, and Kids

Zoro hasn’t met any children or cats while in his foster home, but he does live with four other dogs!

And BOY does he LOVE to play with his canine siblings! His current favorite playmate is a big husky, but you can find him pestering all of his canine siblings (varying in size) to play with him. If you’re lucky, you’ll see his signature play move: slithering around like a little snake!


Behavior around People

Zoro is a huge fan of people! He’s a little shy at first, but once you’ve made his acquaintance, you’re fast friends! He loves to cuddle to end his day (especially after some playtime with the people and dogs who love him!)

He’s happy to leave you alone though as long as he’s got something to do!

Exercise Needs

Like most puppies, Zoro does well with a few heavy duty play sessions! He may need longer walks as he gets older, but for now, he’s happy to just goof off with his people and bounce around.

We love Zoro and know you will, too. Contact us today!

Welcome back, Nutmeg!

You may recognize this pretty girl as one of the puppies from Winnie’s litter this past Christmas season. She’s growing up quickly and is just as gorgeous as her Mom. She currently weighs in at 45 pounds at around 7 months, but will likely top out around 65 pounds.

Housebreaking, Crate-Training, and Commands

Nutmeg is both crate AND house-trained! She does great on a schedule and keeps her crate clean at night. She does need a little bribe (like a treat!) to go in her crate, but otherwise, she does so well and is such a good girl.

Behavior around other Dogs, Cats, and Kids

Nutmeg has done great with cats, dogs, and children! She’s a little nervous with both cats and dogs, but is friendly and happy to interact once she warms up.

She is also good with her human foster siblings, but because she’s always SO excited, she’d likely do better with older children until she learns to keep all four paws on the floor!

Behavior around People

Nutmeg LOVES people! She’s so sweet and will happily snuggle anyone who will let her.

Exercise Needs

With a gait like a baby deer, watching Nutmeg run around is such a fun treat! She’s got the typical puppy energy, but just about any exercise regimen is enough to tucker her out and let her snuggle right up to you.

Those hazel eyes had us swooning at first sight! In love? Contact us today!

If you’d like to be considered to adopt, the first step in the process is to submit an application through our website: http://athenscaninerescue.com/adoption-procedures/. Our adoption fee is $250 per dog over the age of 6 months and $300 per dog 6 months or younger. We accept payment by Venmo, PayPal, or card.

This includes: basic vet care (i.e. basic vaccinations, including boosters completed after adoption, spay/neuter, heartworm/flea preventatives, and treatment for any health needs while in our care), a microchip, a week’s worth of food for the trial-period, and a harness lead.

All in state applications will be considered with some preference given to more local applications. WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING OUT OF STATE APPLICATIONS FOR DOGS SIX MONTHS OR YOUNGER.

We do not have a facility and operate through a network of foster homes. Thus, we do not have a phone number. If you’d like to discuss potential adoptions, please email at adopt@athenscaninerescue.com."

Introducing Pup-pup, a striking blond and white charmer with adorable white toes! At 2 years old, this medium-sized sweetheart is looking for a patient family who can help him reach his full potential.
While life changes have brought Pup-pup to the shelter, his previous family provided valuable insights into his personality.

Meet Cleo!

A charming eight-year-old Staffordshire/Cocker Spaniel mix from Columbus, GA, whose silky white coat and gentle eyes invite you into her peaceful world. Cleo's days are well spent basking in the sun's warmth or wandering leisurely on walks, where every path is her favorite. This medium-sized lady weighs in at 55 pounds and carries her love for stuffed animal speaker toys as joyfully as her fondness for snacks!

Cleo is a master of commands like sit, stay, and shake, making her a delightful and responsive companion. Although she has not received formal obedience training, her repertoire of tricks is impressive. At home, Cleo is a constant companion, happy to share a couch for some cuddle time. She's very affectionate and loves to express her fondness by gently placing her paw on you.

Living with deafness, Cleo has adapted beautifully, responding to hand motions and filling her environment with a sense of understanding. While Cleo typically enjoys a serene demeanor, she can be cautious around strangers, where her nervousness may show as defensive behavior. Understanding and patience with her comfort zone will help Cleo feel secure and loved.

Her health is well-maintained with up-to-date vaccinations, and she's spayed, microchipped, crate-trained, and house-trained, making her ready for any home willing to embrace her with love and patience. Cleo cherishes her snacks and treats, which are always a highlight of her day!

The most endearing part of Cleo's day is when she gets to express her affection. She's not shy about offering a gentle paw to show her love, creating moments of pure connection. Cleo enjoys the company of other dogs as long as they are friendly, and she maintains a gentle curiosity towards smaller animals, though she likes to keep her toys close.

Are you ready to fill your days with sunshine and gentle paw pats? Can you offer Cleo a loving home that speaks her language of quiet companionship and tender care?

If you're interested in providing Cleo with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting her! Please note that Cleo will remain with her current family until a suitable new home is found for her."

73586750,Amie,Dutch Shepherd,,True,Adult,Female,Medium,Brindle,Black,Short,Furry Foots,GA1122,30337,2,True,False,,False,False,"College Park, GA","Affectionate, Protective, Athletic, Loyal, Playful, Gentle, Quiet, Smart",Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered.","Meet Amie
Are you looking for a loyal companion who is down to snuggle in bed, or go on a 6 mi hike? A dog that will amuse you with belly displays, zoomies in the yard, and as many kisses as you'll allow (maybe just one or two more!)? Look no further than Miss Amie Verna Velvet!

Amie gets her name from her bunny soft ears, something her foster noticed right away. She also noticed Amie was quite shy when she first arrived, and after being dumped by her previous owner it's no wonder as to why. Amie was picked up by Fulton County early in 2024 and has been living in foster since March. She is spayed, vaccinated, and has been working with a local dog trainer to learn how to be the perfect house dog.

Amie loves outdoor time just as much as she enjoys hanging at the house all day with you. She would love a home with a person or small family that enjoys daily walks and maybe a hike or two on the weekends. Amie walks well on a prong collar but does need that equipment to handle reactivity towards critters and dogs. She is also still learning to chase appropriate toys like balls and frisbees instead of squirrels and cats. Because of her high prey drive, Amie cannot be adopted to homes with cats, and a home with other dogs would be carefully considered.

In addition to her athleticism, Amie is exceptionally sweet, and just melts on the floor for a belly rub with the slightest look of affection. As you can see in the pics, she loves a good midday nap. This is a very loyal dog, so if you've dreamed of having a protector in dog form, Amie is your girl.

Amie's adoption comes with 6 free hours of professional dog training to set you and her up for success. Both Amie's trainer and foster want her to have the best possible home so they are in her corner willing to help however they can-what a lucky dog!

Amie is fully vaccinated, spayed, and available for adoption in Georgia only. Furry Foots operates solely on donations, so her adoption cost is covered. Please email furryfootsatl@gmail.com for an application."

Are you ready for an obedience trained, athletic, down-for-adventure canine companion? A dog that will be ready to jump in the car and go wherever and also snuggle up for late night movies? Read on for detail about beautiful Isla:

Isla is a ~3 year old Carolina dog mix located in South Fulton. She was originally picked up as a stray when she was about 10 months old. She was lucky enough to be trained and cared for by her a wonderful foster. Isla's foster mom has put in a lot of work with her, so Isla knows all her basic commands, how to walk on a leash, and is crate trained.

Isla herself is a sweet and affectionate dog, eager to please and quick to learn. Isla is highly attentive and will remain focused on her handler even in chaotic situations. That being said, Isla does have a high prey drive, likely due to her breed mix. This just means she would likely do best in a home without cats or other small dogs.

Isla currently lives with an xl Pyr, and doesn't have issues meeting other dogs. However, Isla and her foster would still prefer Isla to be the only dog in the house, as she is very loyal to her humans and thrives with attention. As for children, Isla doesn't have a lot of experience with small children so ideally she will find placement in a home without children.

Isla is fully vaccinated, spayed, and available for adoption in Georgia only. Furry Foots operates solely on donations, so her adoption cost is covered. Please email furryfootsatl@gmail.com for an application."

Now Jeff is caring for Tucker, but Jeff would like to find a more suitable home for Tucker because Jeff has health issues preventing him from giving Tucker the best home where his people have time for him.

Tucker: Male; about 11 years old; neutered; up-to-date on vaccinations; unknown about heart worm status and not on heart worm preventative; weighs about 50 pounds; Labrador Retriever mix; not sure whether he gets along with other dogs because Jeff hasn't had him around other dogs; unknown about cats except Jeff said ""there was an outside cat that he started getting comfortable with""; unknown about other animals; gets along with children; never bitten or tried biting anyone but is a little protective; does not climb or jump fences; is housebroken; lives indoors. Jeff says, ""Tucker is a great dog, he's very lovable once he warms up to you, he's a protector.""

Max is a 1-year-old neutered male Redbone Coonhound/Doberman Pinscher mix, the best we can tell. He was found as a stray on the side of the road and finished his stray hold period with the county where he was not reclaimed. Max is very friendly with other dogs and children, but cats are an unknown. He will chase chickens and ducks, so better he have a home without these animals. Max has shown no aggression and he's housebroken. He does not jump, climb, or dig under fences. He spends his days outside and sticks close to his family. He is crated trained (he's crated over night with no problems and while we are away from the house). Max is very affectionate...he loves licking toes and getting rubbed on his head and chest. He is a very sweet dog and responsive to commands. Max does have a high energy level, but he takes long afternoon naps. Max is heart worm negative and on heart worm preventative. Max is up-to-date on his rabies vaccination. Max needs to be rehomed because we have too many pets at this time.

Billy was recently rescued from a local high kill shelter where he was on the euthanasia list after being picked up as a stray. He was already neutered and microchipped, but the telephone number through the microchip was not in working order.

Billy is a mix of dachshund and beagle and maybe a few other breeds. He's as cute as a button, with a head disproportionately larger than his body, giving him a unique look. He's a happy guy, gets along great with other dogs, and is easy to care for. He weighs probably around 35 lbs. (will have exact weight later this week), is housebroken, takes treats easily, and doesn't bother anything, except he doesn't seem to like cats...so he needs to go to a home with NO CATS.

If you are interested in Billy, please contact us at muchadohounds@hotmail.com so that we can send you an adoption application to see if Billy is a good fit for your family. Please contact us for a video of Billy.

Home check, fenced in yard, and veterinarian reference is required.

Billy lives in Gwinnett County, GA. Adoption fee is $100."

THIS IS A GUEST POSTING. PLEASE CONTACT KING'S OWNER, Khadijah Bilal, at khadij.bilal@gmail.com or 404.453.3690 for more information on King. Below is the information on King reported by the owner.
________________________________________________________

King is a 10-month-old (birthdate: 8/18/2023) purebred German Shepherd and, according to his owner, is AKC registered. The family bought King from a breeder in Alabama the end of September, 2023, and they now want to rehome him at no fault of King's because the children have lost interest in him. King is still intact so will need to be neutered when he is about a year old. King weighs 90 pounds and lives in Clayton County, Georgia.

The owner reports that when King goes to doggy daycare, she is told that he does not seem comfortable around smaller breeds. Cats are unknown because King has never been around cats, so caution would need to be taken there or re-homed in a non-cat household. King does great around children but needs to be in a household with older children because of his high activity level. He needs training not to jump up on people. The owner said King has shown no aggression.

King is housebroken but spends most of his time outdoors when weather permits (unless it's very hot outside or there is inclement weather. ) King is not on heart worm preventative but is up-to-date on vaccinations.

The owner says King is a very sweet and smart dog and seems to be a quick learner when they are consistent in their training.

Fenced in yard, veterinarian reference, and home visit prior to adoption are required."

This is what Manuel says about Gobi.
__________________________________________________________
Gobi is very sweet and has shown no aggression although he is an active dog. He weighs about 55 pounds, is neutered, and up-to-date on vaccinations. Gogi is about 2 years old, was adopted from a local animal shelter in July 2023, and needs to be re-homed because his owner's parents (with whom the owner lives) are older and are unable to deal with his level of energy. The owner says, ""he is not the safest dog to have around the elderly. For instance, he had knocked over my elderly mother multiple times by way of jumping up at her or just running past her and clipping her."" Gobi gets along with other dogs, and children, even small children, but would probably be better with older children due to his energy level. Cats are a NO, because, according to the owner, ""whilst walking him through the neighborhood, upon seeing a cat he launched into a fit of barking and pulling in an attempt to pursue the cat."" The owner also states, ""I don't have the time to spend to with him to give him the fulfilling life he deserves.""

According to the owner, Gobi ""is on the higher end of the spectrum, for him to not have any major issues throughout the day he requires at minimum four miles of fast walking or light jogging in the morning. Preferably a 1-2 mile maintenance walk later in the day.

The owner states that Gobi does not climb or dig under fences, is housebroken, and has been living indoors. He is heart worm negative and on heart worm preventative.

The owner states that Gobi is ""excellent with older children and teenagers, he loves roaming through the forest, running, and playing fetch. He is also very trainable.""

Gobi lives in Gwinnett County. A fenced in yard, home visit, and veterinarian reference is required."

______________________
Holli adopted Ryder from a rural shelter two years ago as a very young dog. He is a 2-year-old beagle mix, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, and heart worm negative (not sure when he was last tested) but not currently on heart worm preventative (last dose was two months ago). He is an active dog but gets along with people (not been around children) and other dogs. He wants to chase cats but doesn't seem to want to hurt them but might hurt them accidentally, so caution needs to be exercised with cats as cats is an unknown.

Ryder weighs probably around 35-40 pounds (not sure of his weight), and is friendly, active, and has shown no aggression. He doesn't jump or climb or dig under fences. He is housebroken but loves his time outside.

Holli has developed health issues, which is keeping her from giving Ryder the quality of life he deserves. She wants what's best for Ryder.

He currently lives with a large dog and two small dogs, so he is friendly with all dogs, large and small. Cats are an unknown.

Ursula was rescued in October from a local high-kill animal control facility. Her time was up, so we took her in. She is currently living in Stone Mountain, GA (Gwinnett County).

Ursula is very, very sweet and loving, and loves lots of attention. While she can be calm, she still has plenty of energy to go around. She is advertised as a purebred boxer, but if not (I'm not an expert in boxers!), she is predominantly boxer (her tail has not been docked and she loves to wag it.). She loves to be with other dogs but prefers them to be relatively calm. Cats are an unknown.

Ursula has no guarding issues (I can pick up her food bowl with no issues) and she takes treats very gently. She is being treated for heart worms as her previous owners obviously failed to give her heart worm preventative. She has already had a 30-day dose of doxycycline (to kill the microfilaria) and is continuing to get a dose of heart worm preventative once per month, which will kill the adult heart worms over a period of about a year. Her right ear pinna is scarred from prior chronic ear infections, but she is cleared of any infection now.

Ursula weighs 60 lbs., is about 7 1/2 years old (best guess), is up-to-date on vaccinations, has no intestinal parasites, and appears to be in good health.

Fenced-in backyard, home check and veterinarian referral is required.

If you are thinking of making Ursula part of your family and would like to meet her, please reply to this post or email Ann Garner at muchadohounds@hotmail.com, and we'll set up a meet-and-greet session.

Meet Dodger!

Dodger is a spirited two-and-a-half-year-old Hound mix from Dallas, GA, who lives for adventure, play, and a touch of charm. Wrapped in a striking tricolor coat, this medium-sized guy weighs about 42 pounds and is ready to bring his zest for life to a new home! Dodger’s boundless energy is infectious. Whether he’s running full-speed at the dog park or heading out for a scenic hike, he gives everything his all. He especially loves having a canine buddy by his side to chase and play with in wide open spaces.

If you love nature as much as Dodger does, you’ll find his “hound point” irresistible. When he spots a butterfly, lizard, or squirrel, he’ll lift his nose and front paw in a perfect salute to nature’s little critters. This natural instinct never fails to entertain his humans, and he’s always ready to explore new places or follow a scent trail on his next adventure.

At home, Dodger is just as delightful. He’s crate-trained and content to settle into his own space at night, sleeping soundly until morning. While he’s well-versed in commands like “sit,” “wait,” and “paw,” Dodger has a bit of a stubborn streak and thrives under the guidance of a confident handler who uses positive reinforcement. Though he’s usually friendly with kids, his high energy may be too much for very young children, so Dodger would do best in a home with older kids or an active family.

Dodger is wonderfully friendly with other dogs and would be thrilled to have a playmate. While he hasn’t had much interaction with cats, he’d love a big yard to explore, chase butterflies, and enjoy the outdoors. And when the day winds down, Dodger’s softer side shines through. He loves snuggling close, especially if it means his humans will give his velvety ears a scratch!

If you’re looking for a high-energy, affectionate companion who’ll keep you entertained and get you outside, Dodger might be your perfect match. Ready to meet him?

If you're interested in providing Dodger with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting him! Please note that Dodger will remain with his current family until a suitable new home is found for him.

Also, Dodger is open to a long-distance adoption—love knows no distance when finding your perfect companion!"

Meet Branch!

A playful one-and-a-half-year-old Labrador Retriever mix from Woodstock, GA, whose youthful energy is wrapped in a beautiful tan coat. This affectionate boy is ready to be your loyal companion, with a love for walks, chasing tennis balls, and curling up next to you for some well-deserved snuggles! At seventy-eight pounds, Branch is a large dog who adores being part of the action, whether it’s playing fetch or simply keeping you company around the house.

Branch is a bright pup, and though he hasn’t had formal obedience training yet, he’s already mastered the basics like sit, stay, and even shake. He’s a quick learner, especially if a treat is involved, and with a little more training, he’d probably be happy to show off more tricks like rolling over! Branch is the kind of dog who thrives on attention and will happily follow you from room to room, just to make sure you’re never lonely (and maybe to see if you’re dropping any tasty snacks).

When it comes to other pets, Branch is selective with dogs—he prefers to meet new canine friends slowly and on his terms. However, he’s great with cats, and has a gentle way about him that’s endearing. He’s also wonderful with kids and loves to be part of a lively household, though his playful side means a fenced yard is ideal for him to safely romp around in.

Branch is protective of his family and may bark at unfamiliar dogs or people, especially if they startle him, but once he sniffs them out and realizes they’re no threat, he’s happy to relax! He has shown this protective instinct in the past when, after being startled by a neighbor's small dog who barked at him, Branch reacted defensively to protect his space and family. A family that understands his need for a secure environment and a little extra patience during introductions would be perfect.

This sweet boy is house-trained, crate-trained, neutered, microchipped, and up to date on his vaccinations, so he’s all set for his new adventure! Could your family be the perfect match for this lovable, curious, and playful pup? If so, Branch can’t wait to meet you and become your new best friend!

Meet Daisy!

A spirited and loving approximately eight-month-old American Pitbull Terrier mix from Tucker, GA, whose zest for life is as bold as her beautiful black coat with striking white accents. Daisy is the epitome of puppy enthusiasm—she’s playful, energetic, and believes that jumping is the ultimate way to show affection. Whether she’s inside cuddling up or outside chasing after her favorite tug-of-war toy, Daisy’s joy comes from being close to her people!

This medium-sized bundle of energy, weighing around fifty pounds when fully grown, is looking for a special home where she can be the center of attention. Daisy thrives in environments where she can be the solo pet, as she’s not too keen on sharing her space or her human companions. While she may not get along with other dogs or cats, she makes up for it with her deep love for her human friends, once she’s had time to warm up to them. Daisy’s protective nature means she’s cautious around strangers, but with patience and a gentle approach, she’ll show you her softer, more affectionate side.

Daisy’s spirited nature does come with a few challenges—she tends to be dominant around other dogs and has shown some aggression in multi-pet households. However, she’s never directed this behavior toward people, and with the right guidance and positive reinforcement, she has the potential to become a more balanced companion. Crate-trained and house-trained, Daisy is already familiar with the basics and is eager to learn more, especially if it means more quality time with her favorite person!

Her ideal new home would be one where she’s the only pet and where her new guardian can dedicate time to helping her adjust, perhaps even with the help of a dog behaviorist. Daisy’s youthful exuberance means she’s ready for lots of walks, playtime, and new adventures, but she’s also content with a quiet night in, just as long as she’s by your side!

Daisy’s playful personality shines through when she tosses her toys in the air, only to chase them down with a wagging tail. Her endearing “smile” is sure to melt your heart, and her loyal, constant companionship will make every day brighter. If you’re looking for a loving, high-energy friend who’s eager to be your one and only, Daisy might just be the perfect match! Are you ready to welcome this adorable pup into your life and give her the forever home she needs?

If you're interested in providing Daisy with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting her! Please note that Daisy will remain with her current family until a suitable new home is found for her.

Meet Arnie!

A brave four-year-old American Pitbull Terrier/Cardigan Welsh Corgi mix from Lilburn, GA, who is a little guy with a big heart and an even bigger desire to be your loyal companion!

Arnie’s story is one of resilience and hope. Though his early days are shrouded in mystery, he has made remarkable progress in the loving care of his current family. Arnie has blossomed into a smart and playful pup who adores the simple joys of life—whether it’s chasing a ball, sprinting after squirrels, or simply curling up beside you after a long day. He’s a medium-sized bundle of love, wrapped in a sleek black coat with charming white accents, weighing in at a sturdy twenty-seven pounds.

Arnie is an intelligent and eager-to-please dog, and while he’s made strides in overcoming his fears, he still has a journey ahead of him. He’s crate-trained and knows several commands, including sit, stay, and come, as well as a few quirky ones like “smoochy sound” for “come here” and “tsschh” for “please stop that.” His learning doesn’t stop there—Arnie is highly treat-motivated and would thrive with a companion guardian who has the patience and experience to continue his training.

One of Arnie’s greatest strengths is his extreme loyalty and his ability to provide comfort and humor. He’s a wonderful companion who listens well and adjusts to the mood of his people. He’s also an energetic hiker or jogger’s dream, and he loves sunbathing. Most of all, he’s always ecstatic when you return home!

While Arnie is affectionate and deeply loyal to his loved ones, he can be wary of new people and situations, often requiring more time than expected and gentle introductions to feel safe. Arnie thrives in a calmer, consistent environment and so would do best with a single person or a couple who lead a quieter life, perhaps with a backyard to romp in or access to peaceful walking trails.

His current family, who deeply love him, want to ensure that Arnie finds a new home where he can continue to grow and thrive. They’re even willing to stay involved in the process to offer support and advice as you and Arnie embark on this new chapter together.

Does Arnie sound like the kind of companion you’ve been looking for? If so, get ready to welcome this courageous and loving pup into your life, and together, you can write the next beautiful chapter of his story!

Are you the gentle, patient, and experienced pet parent Arnie needs?

A charming eight-year-old Staffordshire/Cocker Spaniel mix from Columbus, GA, whose silky white coat and gentle eyes invite you into her peaceful world. Cleo's days are well spent basking in the sun's warmth or wandering leisurely on walks, where every path is her favorite. This medium-sized lady weighs in at 55 pounds and carries her love for stuffed animal speaker toys as joyfully as her fondness for snacks!

Cleo is a master of commands like sit, stay, and shake, making her a delightful and responsive companion. Although she has not received formal obedience training, her repertoire of tricks is impressive. At home, Cleo is a constant companion, happy to share a couch for some cuddle time. She's very affectionate and loves to express her fondness by gently placing her paw on you.

Living with deafness, Cleo has adapted beautifully, responding to hand motions and filling her environment with a sense of understanding. While Cleo typically enjoys a serene demeanor, she can be cautious around strangers, where her nervousness may show as defensive behavior. Understanding and patience with her comfort zone will help Cleo feel secure and loved.

Her health is well-maintained with up-to-date vaccinations, and she's spayed, microchipped, crate-trained, and house-trained, making her ready for any home willing to embrace her with love and patience. Cleo cherishes her snacks and treats, which are always a highlight of her day!

The most endearing part of Cleo's day is when she gets to express her affection. She's not shy about offering a gentle paw to show her love, creating moments of pure connection. Cleo enjoys the company of other dogs as long as they are friendly, and she maintains a gentle curiosity towards smaller animals, though she likes to keep her toys close.

Are you ready to fill your days with sunshine and gentle paw pats? Can you offer Cleo a loving home that speaks her language of quiet companionship and tender care?

Our sweet, loving Cranberry was rescued from a local high-kill shelter where he was scheduled to be euthanized simply due to lack of space! We couldn’t let that happen to this beautiful boy and so he’s been rescued and is now in the search for his perfect home.

Cranberry would prefer a quiet home, maybe with someone who works from home or is retired as he is very anxious in the crate.

Hi, I'm Jade!
I am on the lookout for a family or person who can provide a good balance of love and structure. I can join an adults-only home with an experienced adopter who can continue to work on my training. I have been attending group training and would love to continue to go after being adopted. I would be content being your only dog, or I could live with another dog that shares my size and has a similar play style. If I do live with another dog, I will require time to adjust and decompress, since I am used to living a single life. Whether you are taking the day to relax at home, riding on the golf cart, or running 10 miles, I am cool with doing whatever it is you have planned for our day together!
If you think I would fit the mold of what you are looking for in your next pup, submit an application today!"

Hiya! My name is Eclipse and I am extremely dog friendly. I am currently in foster with four other dogs! I am completely house and kennel trained. I truly am the sweetest girl when given the chance to show you. I love to give kisses and hugs. My foster mom says I am very smart! I have always been a huge staff and volunteer favorite. I have built a lot of confidence from being in foster but I know there is still more to learn. Apply for me today, I'd love to find my next best friend :)"

Meet Boba!

A lively five-and-a-half-year-old American Bully located in Arden, NC, who is a delightful bundle of joy wrapped in a striking tricolor coat! This medium-sized girl, weighing in at forty-six pounds, is the ultimate combination of playful energy and constant companionship. Whether you’re heading out for a neighborhood walk or planning a hiking adventure, Boba will be right by your side, eager for the next great activity. She’s a big fan of all kinds of toys, and her enthusiasm for playtime is boundless!

Boba had formal training and proudly knows commands like “sit,” “down,” and “come” when you call her name. While she might have a bit of a stubborn streak, she thrives with a guardian who can provide consistent training and a loving, structured environment. She’s crate trained and does well staying in her crate when left alone for short periods, making her a great companion for someone with a busy schedule. Though she experiences mild separation anxiety, her crate provides comfort, and she’ll be happily waiting for you to return.

With a playful, high-energy nature, Boba is perfect for a home with a fenced yard where she can safely run and release all that joyful energy. She enjoys being around other dogs and young children, making her a friendly addition to a family. Boba hasn’t had much experience with cats, so her new family would need to take introductions slowly if there’s a feline member of the household. However, she’ll truly shine in a home where she’s the only pet, receiving all the love and attention she craves.

Boba’s sweet side shines through when she curls up with you, enjoying cozy moments with her beloved bed and blankets. She’s an affectionate girl who’ll follow you everywhere, offering her companionship in every room. Though she’s good in public, loud noises can make her a little nervous, so she’d love a calm, supportive environment.

Are you ready to welcome this loyal, loving girl into your life?

If you're interested in providing Boba with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting her! Please note that Boba will remain with her current family until a suitable new home is found for her.

Also, Boba is open to a long-distance adoption—love knows no distance when finding your perfect companion!"

Meet Arnie!

A brave four-year-old American Pitbull Terrier/Cardigan Welsh Corgi mix from Lilburn, GA, who is a little guy with a big heart and an even bigger desire to be your loyal companion!

Arnie’s story is one of resilience and hope. Though his early days are shrouded in mystery, he has made remarkable progress in the loving care of his current family. Arnie has blossomed into a smart and playful pup who adores the simple joys of life—whether it’s chasing a ball, sprinting after squirrels, or simply curling up beside you after a long day. He’s a medium-sized bundle of love, wrapped in a sleek black coat with charming white accents, weighing in at a sturdy twenty-seven pounds.

Arnie is an intelligent and eager-to-please dog, and while he’s made strides in overcoming his fears, he still has a journey ahead of him. He’s crate-trained and knows several commands, including sit, stay, and come, as well as a few quirky ones like “smoochy sound” for “come here” and “tsschh” for “please stop that.” His learning doesn’t stop there—Arnie is highly treat-motivated and would thrive with a companion guardian who has the patience and experience to continue his training.

One of Arnie’s greatest strengths is his extreme loyalty and his ability to provide comfort and humor. He’s a wonderful companion who listens well and adjusts to the mood of his people. He’s also an energetic hiker or jogger’s dream, and he loves sunbathing. Most of all, he’s always ecstatic when you return home!

While Arnie is affectionate and deeply loyal to his loved ones, he can be wary of new people and situations, often requiring more time than expected and gentle introductions to feel safe. Arnie thrives in a calmer, consistent environment and so would do best with a single person or a couple who lead a quieter life, perhaps with a backyard to romp in or access to peaceful walking trails.

His current family, who deeply love him, want to ensure that Arnie finds a new home where he can continue to grow and thrive. They’re even willing to stay involved in the process to offer support and advice as you and Arnie embark on this new chapter together.

Does Arnie sound like the kind of companion you’ve been looking for? If so, get ready to welcome this courageous and loving pup into your life, and together, you can write the next beautiful chapter of his story!

Are you the gentle, patient, and experienced pet parent Arnie needs?

Meet Dodger!

Dodger is a spirited two-and-a-half-year-old Hound mix from Dallas, GA, who lives for adventure, play, and a touch of charm. Wrapped in a striking tricolor coat, this medium-sized guy weighs about 42 pounds and is ready to bring his zest for life to a new home! Dodger’s boundless energy is infectious. Whether he’s running full-speed at the dog park or heading out for a scenic hike, he gives everything his all. He especially loves having a canine buddy by his side to chase and play with in wide open spaces.

If you love nature as much as Dodger does, you’ll find his “hound point” irresistible. When he spots a butterfly, lizard, or squirrel, he’ll lift his nose and front paw in a perfect salute to nature’s little critters. This natural instinct never fails to entertain his humans, and he’s always ready to explore new places or follow a scent trail on his next adventure.

At home, Dodger is just as delightful. He’s crate-trained and content to settle into his own space at night, sleeping soundly until morning. While he’s well-versed in commands like “sit,” “wait,” and “paw,” Dodger has a bit of a stubborn streak and thrives under the guidance of a confident handler who uses positive reinforcement. Though he’s usually friendly with kids, his high energy may be too much for very young children, so Dodger would do best in a home with older kids or an active family.

Dodger is wonderfully friendly with other dogs and would be thrilled to have a playmate. While he hasn’t had much interaction with cats, he’d love a big yard to explore, chase butterflies, and enjoy the outdoors. And when the day winds down, Dodger’s softer side shines through. He loves snuggling close, especially if it means his humans will give his velvety ears a scratch!

If you’re looking for a high-energy, affectionate companion who’ll keep you entertained and get you outside, Dodger might be your perfect match. Ready to meet him?

If you're interested in providing Dodger with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting him! Please note that Dodger will remain with his current family until a suitable new home is found for him.

Meet Branch!

A playful one-and-a-half-year-old Labrador Retriever mix from Woodstock, GA, whose youthful energy is wrapped in a beautiful tan coat. This affectionate boy is ready to be your loyal companion, with a love for walks, chasing tennis balls, and curling up next to you for some well-deserved snuggles! At seventy-eight pounds, Branch is a large dog who adores being part of the action, whether it’s playing fetch or simply keeping you company around the house.

Branch is a bright pup, and though he hasn’t had formal obedience training yet, he’s already mastered the basics like sit, stay, and even shake. He’s a quick learner, especially if a treat is involved, and with a little more training, he’d probably be happy to show off more tricks like rolling over! Branch is the kind of dog who thrives on attention and will happily follow you from room to room, just to make sure you’re never lonely (and maybe to see if you’re dropping any tasty snacks).

When it comes to other pets, Branch is selective with dogs—he prefers to meet new canine friends slowly and on his terms. However, he’s great with cats, and has a gentle way about him that’s endearing. He’s also wonderful with kids and loves to be part of a lively household, though his playful side means a fenced yard is ideal for him to safely romp around in.

Branch is protective of his family and may bark at unfamiliar dogs or people, especially if they startle him, but once he sniffs them out and realizes they’re no threat, he’s happy to relax! He has shown this protective instinct in the past when, after being startled by a neighbor's small dog who barked at him, Branch reacted defensively to protect his space and family. A family that understands his need for a secure environment and a little extra patience during introductions would be perfect.

This sweet boy is house-trained, crate-trained, neutered, microchipped, and up to date on his vaccinations, so he’s all set for his new adventure! Could your family be the perfect match for this lovable, curious, and playful pup? If so, Branch can’t wait to meet you and become your new best friend!

If you're interested in providing Branch with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting him! Please note that Branch will remain with his current family until a suitable new home is found for him.

Meet Daisy!

A spirited and loving approximately eight-month-old American Pitbull Terrier mix from Tucker, GA, whose zest for life is as bold as her beautiful black coat with striking white accents. Daisy is the epitome of puppy enthusiasm—she’s playful, energetic, and believes that jumping is the ultimate way to show affection. Whether she’s inside cuddling up or outside chasing after her favorite tug-of-war toy, Daisy’s joy comes from being close to her people!

This medium-sized bundle of energy, weighing around fifty pounds when fully grown, is looking for a special home where she can be the center of attention. Daisy thrives in environments where she can be the solo pet, as she’s not too keen on sharing her space or her human companions. While she may not get along with other dogs or cats, she makes up for it with her deep love for her human friends, once she’s had time to warm up to them. Daisy’s protective nature means she’s cautious around strangers, but with patience and a gentle approach, she’ll show you her softer, more affectionate side.

Daisy’s spirited nature does come with a few challenges—she tends to be dominant around other dogs and has shown some aggression in multi-pet households. However, she’s never directed this behavior toward people, and with the right guidance and positive reinforcement, she has the potential to become a more balanced companion. Crate-trained and house-trained, Daisy is already familiar with the basics and is eager to learn more, especially if it means more quality time with her favorite person!

Her ideal new home would be one where she’s the only pet and where her new guardian can dedicate time to helping her adjust, perhaps even with the help of a dog behaviorist. Daisy’s youthful exuberance means she’s ready for lots of walks, playtime, and new adventures, but she’s also content with a quiet night in, just as long as she’s by your side!

Daisy’s playful personality shines through when she tosses her toys in the air, only to chase them down with a wagging tail. Her endearing “smile” is sure to melt your heart, and her loyal, constant companionship will make every day brighter. If you’re looking for a loving, high-energy friend who’s eager to be your one and only, Daisy might just be the perfect match! Are you ready to welcome this adorable pup into your life and give her the forever home she needs?

If you're interested in providing Daisy with a loving home, please email adopt@joyfulpets.com for more information on adopting her! Please note that Daisy will remain with her current family until a suitable new home is found for her.

Why Choose Me?
Foster update: We were so blessed to meet Binky! Binks, as we call him, is known to be somewhere between 3 and 4 years old, and is truly one of the sweetest dogs I have ever met. He is super cuddly, LOVES attention, and loves to play with his toys! He is potty trained, and we have been told he is good with other dogs! He has also been great with meeting new people! Unfortunately, Binks has been diagnosed with heartworm, but he is currently finishing up the last of his medication for that! We were told that Binks was kept as an outside dog, but he has acclimated so quickly and so well to our apartment. We would love to find this sweet boy a forever home with lots of room for him to lounge around.


Binky is a handsome boy, and he charmed me with his good nature and manners. He liked playing fetch and would bring the ball back, but after a few rounds, he was ready to sit in the shade with a friend and enjoy treats and pets. He's a really nice dog who likes to please, knows how to sit, and is easy on a leash. Sadly, Binky has heartworms, so if he's not reclaimed, he'll only be available for rescue, foster, or foster-to-adopt. Once his heartworm treatment is completed, he'll also be available for adoption.

Foster update: We LOVE this guy!! He is such a precious old man!
In just 5 days he's gained a healthy amount of weight and is doing so well! He gets along great with all of our dogs, completely ignores the cats, and has even said hello to the ferret without much interest! He does get concerned/thinks he needs to help if we're in the horses field, but once we tell him we're ""ok"" he settles down! Waldo is also crate and house trained! He seems a bit hard of hearing at times, but that just adds to his cute old man persona!
* * *

Donald is a friendly dog who was all smiles when I took him out this morning. He has three white tufts of fur on the top of his head that look like splashes of paint. I scratched his head to see if he'd been around some paint (he hadn't), and he liked that. He also liked sitting for treats, and when he was ready for one, he'd look at me and sit on his own hoping I'd reward him. Donald is a nice dog with good manners. He's missing some fur on his backend which is an easy fix with proper care.

Trixie is a little shy but once she trusts you, she's all smiles and tail wags. She's afraid of leashes, so we walked only as far as the interaction pen across from her kennel. She had fun running around the pen and watching other people and dogs. She also liked pets and a few treats. She's a sweet girl who longs for a friend.

73259247,Lady,Mixed Breed,,False,Young,Female,Large,,,,Athenspets,GA862,30605,3,,False,,,False,"Athens, GA",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Meet Lady

Why Choose Me?
Update:Sadly, Lady is back at the shelter. She needs a home without cats. She's as happy, sweet, and playful as ever, and we had a great time playing with toys. She also minds well and quickly sits for treats. She's a wonderful best friend who is so ready for her forever family.

Doggy-Day-Out update: Lady was AMAZING this morning at the Farmers Market. She was too scared to get in the car on her own... she needed picked up and put in both times, but once she was in the car, she laid down and rode like an angel in the backseat! At the market, she was so easy to handle on a leash, and she was a doll with everyone she met. My favorite was how gentle she was when kids approached. She'd sit in front of them and kindly accept pets. She sits for treats. She seemed to want to be friends with other dogs (definitely got excited when they got close to her), but I didn't really let her interact much in this situation. That said, she didn't have any issue with dogs passing and didn't show any reactivity on the fenceline at the shelter. Overall I was super duper impressed. My biggest takeaway is that she wants love. She really appreciated when people would sit and give her affection.
* * *
Lady is a sweet, friendly girl. She loves toys, and we had the best time playing fetch. It was a hot day, so we only played a few rounds, but she was good about bringing the toys back to a towel I had in the shade. Lady also knows how to sit and shake. Her former owner said she lived as an outside dog, is crate trained, and is good with kids (she's been around children ages 5 - 12). I enjoyed being with Lady. She minds well and is fun to be with.

Why Choose Me?
Foster update: My husband and I have been fostering Smoke for a few weeks. I know him really well now.
Update , he is a sweet angel and has a good heart. Smoke is 100% a good dog. He is home and crate trained, he does not chew anything except for his toys. He sleeps quietly in his cage every night.
I will continue to do training with him with a professional dog trainer, but he is still looking for his forever home. Someone looking to adopt Smoke should be PATIENT or it won't work. It took 7 days for Smoke to warm up to my husband .. but now
they are best buddies. If you are looking for a dog that will
be perfect the first day, you should not take Smoke. If you are ready to give him time and to reward his good behaviors, you will end up with a love bug. Smoke like to run and play outside. He enjoys walks as much as he love to
lay in the sun and do nothing. Once Smoke find his safe spot/person, you got the best friend in him.
ps He really loves the couch if you are sitting on it. He will jump up and try to lay with you.
He is not dog/bat friendly but the trainings will adress it.

Update: Smoke's Weekend Getaway: Hi, I am a volunteer at the shelter and If I could stand by Smoke kennel's all day long to encourage you to give him a chance, I would. All you need to do is get his trust and see him somewhere else other than in a stressful environment like a shelter.
If you are looking for a
lot of love , Smoke is the one for you. At first sight, in his kennel, Smoke looks like he is a lot and might be intimidating with all his energy. However, I just spent 4 days and 3 nights with him and let me tell you the real story. YES, Smoke gets really excited when he sees the leash, but who would not be. it can also be difficult to put the harness on him, but once you got it , and you take him for a walk, you will get the best companion. He walk well on a leash but he still reacts to other dogs. Once he will find his home, with some training, he will be ok . Smoke was following me around in the house , we went outside a lot, I did some gardening, Halloween decorations and he wont leave my side . He likes to play with toys and will bring it back to you as long as you wish. Like every dog, he needs to spent his energy, after walking or playing a bit, you will find Smoke laying on his cushion or in the little sunny spot in your house just relaxing. He does not bark, he is house trained and I was happy to see that he is also crate trained. He even went to sit in the crate by himself. He slept without a noise all night. He loves treats... and cheese is his favorite ? . With treats, it took me 5 minutes to teach him to sit, to stay and to drop the toys. But, please don't expect Smoke to show you all those tricks the first time.. Like us, good habits need practice. But I tell you, he is smart enough to learn all the tricks.
Smoke love car rides, he jumps in and out without any problem and will lay on the back seat or sit and get ready to explore the world with you.
I don't know Smoke story but I know for sure that he deserves a second chance to get the best life.
* * *
Update: Smoke's Doggy-Day-Out: This last 2 days, I took Smoke to multiple places like park, walks, Lowes etc including my house. He was absolutely adorable. He loves the car, he love to play with toys and he just want to be cuddle all the time. I did gardening with him and he never left me, he was just walking with me, digging some holes in the mulch looking at what I was doing. He was pretty relax and was able to nap on my thighs, in the car, on the floor, the grass etc. The only thing I would say is I think he did not see a lot of shopping cart before and that made him anxious at Lowes.
* * *
Update: I remember Smoke. He came to the shelter earlier this summer and was adopted. Sadly, he's been surrendered. When he arrived in June, he was too frightened to walk with me to an interaction pen, but I later saw him relaxing in a kiddie pool. He loved the water and still does. Today, I had no problem taking him out. He greeted me at his gate wagging his tail. Once we reached the interaction pen, I figured he'd head for the pool, and he did. I sat on the bench watching him have fun, and to my surprise, when I called him to join me, he left the water and came over. He put his head on my lap and enjoyed being petted. I was thinking, ""He's come so far from that scared pup months earlier."" Smoke's former owner said he doesn't like new people and doesn't do well with kids or other dogs. Today, I was a new person to Smoke, and he was wonderful and sweet and wanted to be loved. I hope he finds his right match and forever home.
* * *
When I first met Smoke, he was too scared to leave the back of his kennel. Later in the day, I saw a dog smiling and lounging in a pool. I looked closer and it was Smoke! I joined him in the interaction pen to take a few pictures but didn't want to disrupt his quiet time. It was good to see him relaxing and settling in.

Update: When I walked by Miracle's kennel today, I didn't recognize her at first--her eyes look so much better! I took her out, and she's as sweet as ever still choosing to be with me rather than exploring or running around and still giving kisses. She's a sweetheart.
* * *
Miracle was initially shy when I met her, but before I took her back to her kennel, she was loving pets and giving me kisses. Miracle hasn't had the best care. Her eyes are gunky, and her coat is thin in places. Still, she's as sweet as she can be and wants to be loved. She deserves to be loved and cared for, and if you look beyond the gunk surrounding her eyes (I tried to gently wipe them), you'll see that she has the sweetest face. Miracle was surrendered with four other dogs. They're all good-natured dogs, and I hope they all find new families to love.

Rambo is a sweet boy, but he was really frightened about leaving his kennel, so I had help getting him leashed. He walked slowly with me to an interaction pen and seemed so sad. Little did he know there was a surprise waiting for him. Two other dogs, Elsa and Snowflake, that were surrendered with him were already in an interaction pen, and as we neared them, Rambo perked up and started wagging his tail. We entered the pen next to them, and there was a happy reunion at the fence. They all touched noses, were wagging their tails, and started trotting along the fence together. I loved seeing them so happy.

After Elsa and Snowflake returned to their kennel, Rambo kept his good spirits. Now, he was coming to me for pets and treats. He's a good boy, and I hope he gets to have another family reunion, or even better, a new family to love.

Why Choose Me?
Foster update: I have been fostering Russel for several days now, and he has proved how loving and loyal of a dog he is.
He is crate-trained, leash-trained, and the ultimate cuddle bug. Russel is so low-maintenance and is happy spending his day cuddling and taking naps. Russel is very nervous when it comes to meeting new people, but he is the perfect dog once he realizes he can trust you. He does tend to bark at other people/dogs, but he is improving with a little bit of patience and training. Russel has some scars/cuts on his legs and face, but they are healing very nicely. Overall, he is the sweetest boy and will be a great addition to someone's home.

When I first met Russel, he wasn't sure about leaving his kennel, but treats paved the way to friendship, and soon he was enjoying pets. He's a cute medium-sized dog who's shy but wants to be loved. After our time together, I saw a huge change in him in his kennel. Instead of backing away, he was coming to the gate wanting to come out again to be with his new friend. He's such a sweetie!

Apollo's former owner said he lived as an indoor dog and is house trained, crate trained, and is good with cats and kids (the children in the home were 13 to 17 years old).

Why Choose Me?

King is part of Project Homebound, Athens-Clarke County's Dog Training Program!

For more information about Project Homebound, please go to https://athenspets.net/project-homebound/.

Update 11/24: King, a 9 month old pup, has been at Athens-Clarke County Animal Services since the end of June. I spent several hours with him the last few days and found him to be friendly to a fault. He hasn't had much training and is a bit rough, jumpy, and mouthy, but was very good walking on the nature trail around the shelter after calming a bit. After our walks, he was content to just hang out with a friend and be a great companion.

A crowded shelter is no place for such a nice pup. King needs to find a foster or permanent home as soon as possible, hopefully with an experienced handler that can round out his rough edges.

* * *
King was so happy to leave his kennel that he was a little bouncy, but this sweet guy is all fun and love. After some playtime chasing toys, he was ready to get on my lap, press his head against me, and be loved. His former owner said King is loving and friendly. He's house trained (used pee pads) and was good with the kids in the home ranging in age from 13 to 17. He's a sweetie who's ready to love a new family!

Update 8/16/24: King had done so well on a couple of walks on the shelter’s nature trail, I took him to Lowe’s to get an idea of what he’d be like in a completely different environment. In short, he was awesome. He jumped right into the car and was a very good passenger. He was good (not perfect) as we walked through the store, greeted everyone appropriately, and took treats gently.

Getting King out of the shelter environment showed what a good dog he can be, but he still had a lot of energy coming out of his kennel. Once that initial energy was worked through, he was a very nice, friendly and well behaved dog.
Please consider King if thinking about getting a foster or taking a dog out for the day. It would do him good to get more experiences with a variety of handlers.

Molly was the last dog I took out and was such a sweet surprise. After spending time with eleven other dogs, I was worn out, but Molly made no demands--she just wanted to please and be loved on. The first thing she did when I sat down was gently get on my lap. When I offered her treats, she'd immediately sit. She was happy to be with a friend, and I enjoyed being with her. I was told that Molly can scale a fence, but while we were together, she never tried. She probably needs to be an indoor dog which I imagine is what Molly would prefer--she wants to be with her loved ones.

He'd also take his ball to the fence to show his canine neighbors--he was so cute trying to get them to join him. He's a sweet, happy, playful boy, and we both had a great time.

* * *
Dune is all about love. When I sat on the bench to take a break, he was on my lap happily wagging his tail like he'd done this before. When I scratched his back, he gave me kisses. He's such a good-natured boy. He's got the sweetest face and a heart of gold.

Why Choose Me?

Temporary Foster Update: Meet Rita! This girl is a Project Homebound graduate, and with that under her doggy belt she's ready to leave the shelter system! She's been in a foster home but they can't keep her much longer so we're hoping to find her a new foster or just *straight up get adopted.*
Her foster says: Rita is the sweetest girl! She is very affectionate and bubbly. She has done so well in an apartment and is completely house/crate trained (she does extremely well in her crate). She can be energetic at times, but she can also be calm and will sleep through the whole night! She loves treats, toys, and being petted.

It may be that Rita does better with women than with men. Her current foster reports that there were a couple of instances where she would bark and act protective and defensive when men would come to the home.

Update: Rita has graduated from Project Homebound, the Jail Dog Program, and is ready for her forever home! She's spent the past few months being trained by inmates at corrections and knows all the basic commands as well as some other commands, too. She showed me how well she can sit, shake, lie down, and come. She'd also hop on the table when asked. Before showing me her skills, Rita had a good time playing with toys. She's an active girl and playing fetch is a great way for her to get her energy out. When she'd return with her toy, she was good about sitting and trading it for a treat. Rita is a happy girl and loves being with people. It was great being with her today, but I hope she finds her forever home soon. Upon adoption, she comes with two free training sessions from Bone-A-Fide Dog Training!

For more information about Project Homebound, please go to https://athenspets.net/project-homebound/.

Doggy-Day-Out update: Rita had a fun day out at Pittard Park today! We started with a brisk walk around the park; she hasn't had many (if any) outings since she came to the shelter, and she had some energy to work out! Once she'd settled down a bit, we met the other volunteers with Athenspets - GA at the Marigold Market. She was friendly when meeting both adults and children.

She desperately wanted to play with the other dogs, and she enjoyed meeting them, though it wasn't an appropriate space for playing. She was already a superstar with ""sit"", so while we where there, I worked with her on lying down, rolling over, spin, up, and off. While she's not a pro at these after one day, she did demonstrate that she is very smart and eager to learn. When the market was over, we took a surprise adventure - a train ride around town! I'm assuming this was a new experience for her, but she settled in easily and enjoyed the ride!

Rita:
? 2 yo, spayed, UTD on everything
? Playful and fun
? Smart and eager to learn
? Friendly with humans of all ages
? Desperately wants to play with new dogs; calm around them after introductions
? Loads easily into car and rides well
? Minimal pulling on the leash, but when she does, she's strong. She's easily redirected and goes back to walking nicely easily.
* * *

******************************************

Update: Rita is so much fun! She enjoys playing with toys, splashing in the pool, and earning treats by giving good sits or hopping on the table. It was a hot day, but Rita wanted to play and chase toys. When she needed to cool off, she'd lounge in the pool or dunk her head and splash about. I remember Rita when she had originally come to the shelter with her buddy Rocco. Both dogs were eventually adopted, but now Rita is back looking for a new home. She's a sweet, energetic girl who's full of joy and loves to play.
* * *
Rita and Rocco are a fun duo. They don't look alike but have much in common. Both like to chase toys, sit for treats, and be together.

Rita likes getting in the pool to cool off, but Rocco won't have anything to do with water except to drink it. Rita often reaches a toy first, but it's Rocco who really loves toys. At one time, he had the coconut toy all to himself, and he kept it in his mouth wandering around the interaction pen. He let me have it, but I could tell he'd rather have kept it. Both are good dogs. Rita has to be reminded not to jump up when she's excited while Rocco is more low key.

They're two sweet dogs ready for good times!

Why Choose Me?

Bambi is a sweet mama. Two of her pups came in with her and while they don't all share a kennel, she didn't want them to be out of her sight. She'd stand in the shade with me and then walk back to the gate to see her pups who were across the grassy area in their kennel. I plan on asking if this trio can have a little reunion the next time I'm here. I know they'd love that. Bambi is a quiet sweetie. She likes treats, pets, and knowing that her babies are safe. She's missing some fur along her back and needs someone who'll care for her as well as she's cared for her little ones.

71939431,Omega,Mixed Breed,,False,Young,Male,Large,,,,Athenspets,GA862,30605,6,,False,True,,False,"Athens, GA",N/A,Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered.","Meet Omega


Why Choose Me?
Foster update: I'm sure we all have a friend, or at least know someone, who is introverted with a strong personality. They don't always enjoy meeting new people. They much prefer smaller group settings and if they have to attend an event with a large number of people, they aren't going to be friendly with everyone. If someone over steps their boundaries, they might even react poorly to them. But if there is one attribute this friend has, THEY ARE LOYAL! They'll never leave your side (maybe needy at sometimes) and they will always be there for you.
Now picture that friend with four legs, and you have Omega! Introverted with people he doesn't know, and until he has a relationship with a person, he might not want them near him. He's not much of a people person, but he can handle himself well as long as his boundaries are respected. Men tend to make him uncomfortable.
He thrives on a good relationship with his handler. He has very good manners, he listens well, and loves attention! He loves other dogs but would do best in a home with a confident dog who is also tolerant. Omega can be pushy to play at times and he plays rough! He is a huge toy dog and is good at keeping himself occupied with them. He is always down for a good hike and running around the yard.
Omega was surrendered with his sibling earlier this year. You can tell neither one had much socialization outside of their household. He lacks confidence in situations he is unfamiliar with, but who can blame him? He was left at a shelter, where not long after his sibling found placement, so everything he knew was gone. His life got flipped upside unexpectedly and he didn't understand what was going on.
He is house broken and crate trained, although the occasional accident in the crate does happen. He doesn't always appreciate being left alone, so a durable crate is needed. He would do best in a quiet home as he will not do well with a constant flow of people coming and going.
Omega is desperately looking for a committed foster, rescue, or adopter! We unfortunately aren't able to commit long term fostering for him since we could move at any time. He completely shuts down at the shelter and none of us want to send him back to that environment. He's grown so much since I brought him home and he deserves a loving home. He may be socially awkward, but he is loyal and so loving ??
* * *
Foster update: Want your own painted dog? Omega is a gorgeous 2 yo pup who is playful with other dogs, very devoted to his people, and overall a very good boy.
- housetrained & cratetrained
- good with dogs (his foster homes have 1, 3, and 6 other dogs in them and he came from a home with another dog)
- happy to share toys with people or other dogs and no signs of guarding food from either (though he is fed separately from other dogs in his foster homes since, well, that's the smart thing to do in multi-dog homes)
- good with the kids and dog-savvy people he's met
- very attached to his people (and open to expanding the circle--he circulates between 3 foster homes and has developed a close relationship with the people in each)
- neutered, HW negative (on preventative), and UTD on vaccines
- affectionate, smart, and eager to learn
The AKC's webage describes Catahoulas as, ""a multi-purpose working dog that is ...serious while working and playful at home. ... [T]hey can be independent, territorial, and protective. For the same reasons, they do not allow mistreatment and will assert themselves in self-defense. Once they know their place in the family unit, they are affectionate, loyal, and gentle.""
This fits Omega to a ""t"" (now I need to look up the history of that expression, lol). While he's curled up next to me snoring right now, he's up and ready to go as soon as I stand up and loves his hikes and play time with dog friends (in the video he and my male are starting to learn to play together).
Omega needs a person who will be confident and respectful, provide non-force-based leadership, and be affectionate with him (in that order)--stand over him before he knows you, use punishment or force, or try to make him submit, and he will become uncomfortable (barking, backing up, not trusting you). But ask him to ""work"" before he gets privileges (ie, sit and wait while you get settled before you invite him on furniture, sit at the door while you leash him)--give him a job, boundaries, and positive rewards--and he flourishes!
What Omega is not:
? a good fit for a person who uses dominance techniques on dogs--he needs a partner and confident leader, not a master
? a dog that can spend time at the shelter--he becomes very depressed and degrades quickly
? a good fit for a home with cats--he does chase them and we don't know what would happen if he caught one (and don't want to find out), even though when he first got to his foster home with that has cats he ignored them so maybe he's just being playful? Still, we think it's too risky for the cat to place him in this situation.
? a happy solo dog--he much prefers to be in a home where there's another dog and he does better crated in the same room as a dog for company
? an apartment dog. At times he has...opinions...and hasn't yet learned to whisper. (He's mostly quiet but if he thinks something is unjust--like being crated when he knows you're still around and just not with him--he will let you know.)
I love this dog and want him to find a great home, but like all of us he needs someone who will love and respect him for who he is, not just what he looks like.
* * *
Temporary foster update: Omega has been in a temporary foster home with another dog, Harris, for about 9 days, and they have become the best of friends. Omega has medium energy. He enjoys being outside but likes to just hang out indoors as well. His favorite game involves being chased by another dog. He quickly learned just how to talk Harris into a game of tag with the balls. He's house trained and super dog friendly. He's also affectionate once he gets to know his people.
* * *
Update: Meet Omega, The Amazing Water Eating Dog! ?
Omega looks like a mild mannered guy (in fact he hides in the back of his kennel-he's intimidated by the noise until he has a canine pal), but he is a SUPER ? when it comes to water eating and chilling with another friendly pup.
Stop by to meet this great guy!

Omega and Alpha came in together and share a kennel. They were new and understandably uncertain about being at the shelter. They barked at their kennel gate, but once they were in an interaction pen, they were friendly, sat for treats, and enjoyed pets. I had them in interaction pens next to one another while I took pictures, and Omega really wanted to be with his brother. Both are sweet, handsome dogs.

Ziggy is a soft, sweet boy with a cute patch circling one eye. He was busy taking in all that was going on around us, but when I sat down on the bench, he'd come to me for pets and treats. Unfortunately, Ziggy has heartworms, so he will only be available for rescue, foster, or foster-to-adopt until he is treated. Once that is completed, he will be available for adoption.

From Briscoe's Foster:

Briscoe has been AMAZING!! I've been meaning to take him for a night to see how he does and I just wish I'd done it sooner. He has been an absolute angel and is just a huge baby. He was so so excited when we walked into my apartment and when I offered him toys I could tell that he was in shock that all of the toys I gave him were his to play with!! He warmed up immediately to my roommates and has been friendly when walking by other people and dogs on walks.

Briscoe does great on leash and is clearly housetrained. You can tell he is very happy to just be loved and cared for in a home environment- he follows me into whatever room I go into and looks at me for approval every time he does something new. It is clear that he just wants to be a good boy and he cuddled into bed with me last night and immediately fell asleep by my side!

What an absolutely wonderful dog!!

Good with kids, dogs and cats

Orrelo is a one-year-old cuddle bug with a calm demeanor. He is dog and cat friendly and currently in a foster home with a resident German Shepherd. He also recently went on a weekend sleepover with two cats in the house and did great!

Orrelo came into a crowded shelter as part of a neglect case. He was only few months old then and hardly 20 pounds but held as ""evidence"" for almost a year until he was finally released for adoption. What we love the most about Orrelo is that he is resilient and despite his traumatic past, he still loves to greet everyone he meets whether humans or furry friends.

Orrelo loves to follow his people around the house and greet guests at the door. He enjoys a leisurely stroll in the neighborhood sniffing along the way and meeting freinds. He is learning not to pull on the leash with the help of a harness. He loves to play with other dogs and will also take corrections from them.

Orrelo has waited a long time for a loving family. He isn't too picky. He just wants to cuddle on the couch or in bed or just lay next to you while you are working. He is wonderful company to have during long car rides too.

Pawsey is sweet, calm, and is pretty content to just have a soft place to sleep and a home to call his own. He is two years old, 60 pounds, but we anticipate some weight gain now that he is in a foster home. He is even more stunning in person.

Pawsey gets along great with other dogs. He has been gentle around kids and we think he might even be cat friendly. Based on preliminary cat testing, he has the potential of co-exiting with feline friends and we can walk you through how to successfully integrate a dog into a home with cats.

In general, Pawsey is on the low-energy side. He is easy to leash, easy to walk, and just about easy to handle in every setting. He enjoys human affection. He will stand still and let you brush him all over!

Pawsey is a gem. He is the perfect balance of looks, temperament, friendliness, and smarts.

Ralph is just a solidly great dog in every respect. Loves other dogs and people, would do best in a home with a yard. Would prefer a family that doesn't require him to travel much in the car - he gets carsick and that's why he was surrendered.

We say older kids because he could knock down toddlers.

Xena is the ultimate cuddle bug, ready to snuggle up behind you and rest her adorable head on your shoulder! She might play hard to get at first, but once she warms up, she's all about being your sidekick.

This little sweetheart is as quiet as a mouse in her crate and walks like a dream on a leash! She's sharp as a tack too, with commands like sit, down, and kennel down pat. Plus, she's a total foodie, which makes training a piece of cake!

Just a heads up-this little adventurer gets a bit queasy in the car and can be a tad picky with her doggy pals, so a gentle introduction is the way to go! She also requests a wide array of acceptable chew toys to keep her entertained.

Annie is the ultimate cuddle bug! This little couch potato loves to lounge but still has some zoomies left in her young bones. She's not your average livestock guardian; she's a diva who demands the royal treatment!

When it comes to furry friends, she can be a bit picky, but with a gentle and gradual intro, she'll warm up like a toasty marshmallow! She'd totally thrive with a buddy dog or a work-from-home human because, this gal hates being left solo!

Ellie is a wonderful dog with a playful spirit. Her favorite way to engage is with mouthiness, but she knows to adapt her play style when we say, ""easy""!

Ellie was rescued from a situation of severe neglect, suffering from deep mange that has left her hair patchy. With a proper diet and regular baths, we anticipate that her fur will continue to grow back. Aside from her skin issues, she is a resilient little one who shows no other signs of the hardships she faced before her rescue.

Tonka and Rip are the ultimate lovebugs! These two furry friends stroll like pros on a leash, constantly checking in with their human sidekick during their adventures. They're practically glued together in a crate, kennel, or just lounging around-wherever they go, they go as a duo!

Still in their playful puppy phase, we're almost out of the wild antics of youth-thank goodness for toys that keep them too busy to chew on the furniture! Now, here's the scoop: they can be a bit dramatic in their kennel, putting on a barking show for any critters that pass by. But outside of their cozy den? They're all about cuddles and love with the cats and other animals! Just a couple of noisy sweethearts who can't help but make a scene!

She's a sweetheart. Loves to play with people and dogs (but let's be honest, she prefers playing with her furry friends). She is a cuddler and will let you pick her up with little complaint.

Did I mention the kisses? Trisha loves showering her people with kisses. She even tries to give us hugs sometimes. She knows sit and learned how to use the doggy door quickly.

Trisha would do best in a home with adults and teens. And dogs. She's got a pretty high prey drive. She would likely do well with older kiddos, 9 or 10 years. There isn't a mean bone in her noodle body. But she gets a little over eager and might push a kiddo down without meaning to.

Basically Trisha is absolutely perfect."

Why Choose Me?

No greeted me inside his kennel and leaned against me as I petted him. He wasn't too sure about going outside because of all the barking. With pets and encouragement, we made it to the interaction pen across the way. Now, he was ready to stretch his legs and had fun running or coming to me for more attention. He's a good-natured boy who wants a friend.

Bo is fun! She was ready to play right away and had a great time playing fetch with a toy duck. She was good about bringing it back, and we played round after round. She loves to run, but she also likes pets and attention. She's a sweet, happy friend!

Atlas was initially shy in his kennel, but with one treat, I had a new buddy. Smiles and tail wags followed, and Atlas enjoyed himself in the interaction pen. He chased a few toys, but what he really liked was giving me good sits for treats. His shirt says ""Trick or Treat,"" but it should say ""Tricks FOR Treats."" He'd sit every time, so we worked on shake. He didn't have it yet, but with more practice, he will.

Why Choose Me?

Foster update: Every minute out of the shelter Walker's confidence is growing! He's a goofy hound, snuggle bug, and has a big personality. At under a year he still has lots of time to mature. He listens well: knows sit, walks well on a leash, responds to redirection, and will go in his kennel. When in his kennel the first 5 min or so he will cry and bark before settling. He gets along great with other dogs.
* * *
Walker is a cute, friendly pup. His ears are adorable and sometimes look like sails when he's running. He's a good-natured sweetie who loves pets and treats. He's learning how to walk on a leash but hasn't learned basic skills like sit yet-that's something he can learn with a new family.

The first toy I threw for him was too big, and he struggled to pick it up, so I found one that was just his size. We played fetch, and he returned his toy round after round. When it was time for Bingo to go, an officer that he's bonded with took him back to his kennel. When Bingo saw his friend, he was wiggling with joy and jumped into his arms when he knelt to pick him up. Bingo hasn't had the best care and is missing much of fur. With proper care, time to trust, and love, Bingo can be someone's best little buddy.

Why Choose Me?

Moonight and Wally are big, handsome brothers. They're strong so I had help taking them to an interaction pen, but I'm glad they had some playtime together. They loved running, playing chase, and just being together. They're good-natured dogs and get along great. I couldn't get them to sit, but they'd come to me and enjoy a few pets before running off to play some more. When it was time to go, they were sad to part, and I hope they get to spend time with each other again, but even more importantly, I hope they find new homes where they can run and play with new families.

Why Choose Me?

Foster update: Butch is a sweet young guy! He likes to play with the other dogs but is not an over-energetic puppy, he also likes to come inside and lay on the couch or right at your feet!
Butch's initial reaction to meeting new people is to be slightly timid, but he warms up quickly! If you tell him he's a good boy he'll be your new best friend!
? House trained
? Crate trained, quite in his crate
? Great with dogs
? Ok with cats, he's a bit fearful of them
? Very sweet and polite
? Knows basic commands
? Walks well on a leash
The only ""con"" I've noticed is Butch does not want to share his food with anyone. He is very easily managed by being fed in his crate so he feels happy and secure while eating!
Butch is such a good and sweet natured pup, I know he's ready to find his forever ?
* * *
Butch is a sweet dog who seems to have gone through a rough patch. When he first arrived at the shelter, he had some wounds on his back that had to be painful. His wounds are healing, and like other dogs, he wants to have fun and enjoy being outside with a friend. He chased a few toys, but once the treats came out, he was all about showing me how well he could sit and lie down to earn them. We also played catch with treats which he liked. He's a good boy.

Why Choose Me?
Update: I was walking down the sidewalk when I saw Pitty Smalls in an interaction pen playing with visitors. A young child was throwing a ball for him to chase, and it made me smile. Pitty Smalls is a sweet, gentle dog, and watching him I wondered if he'd lived with children in his previous home. He's always a good boy for me, and I hope he finds a new family to love.

Pitty Smalls is a friendly dog and was ready for fun in an interaction pen. I threw a tennis ball for him, and while he didn't bring it back, he had the best time chasing it. He tried picking it up but fumbled it and then kept kicking it as he ran to get it. Maybe that was part of his game to keep the ball moving. Eventually, Pitty Smalls wore himself out and joined me in the shade where he enjoyed scratches along his back and behind his ears. He's a sweet, happy boy.

Their former owner said they lived as outdoor dogs, are okay with other dogs, and are good with kids of all ages. They're sweet girls, and it's so great to see them happy and having fun.

His favorite activities are making sure his people and home are safe, picking up litter on walks so you can discard it (cares about his environment!), and babysitting tennis balls. What he lacks in small-ness he makes up for in the puppy playfulness. He's crate-trained, good on a leash with harness, and mostly house-trained (so close!). His foster home includes both cats and dogs and he prefers his kitty friends.

Bavaria aka Ari is a small ball of energy with a big heart! She is smart, loyal, and loves everyone person she meets! Her favorite activities include cuddles, walks, and naps with her pup friends. Ari gets along with dogs her size and smaller. She is 42 pounds. It takes her some time to warm up to bigger dogs, but she does have a few large breed friends that she's made while with her foster family. Her foster family runs a doggie daycare and boarding service from their home and while Ari get along with most of the dogs, we think she'd be happiest in a home with only 1 or 2 other pups. Ari hasn't encountered any cats so we don't know how she will do with feline company. She hasn't been around kids but based on her temperament we think she would be fine around older respectful kids.

Ari is fully crate trained and housebroken. She uses the doggie door and takes her meals in her crate. Ari is VERY food motivated. She'll run into her crate to let you know that she's ready to eat or if she thinks she's about to get a treat. She also LOVES the scent of her human and will bring a stray shoe or sock into her crate. Only one of each though because Ari knows sharing is caring. LOL! She won't damage the item and will gladly relinquish it without a fight.

We have noticed mild resource guarding during meal times around other dogs. Ari will growl if a dog comes close to her bowl but we it is mostly posturing. She has never demonstrated any sort of resource guarding with people. Video of her manners.
https://youtu.be/iMnENrFlSNM

Ari has come a long way with leash training and with consistent walks she will continue to improve. She is manageable and does not pull as much. She does well on car rides too. What we love about her is that she will match your energy. If you are sitting around, she'll sit with you. If you are outside on a stroll, she'll love that too.

Age: 2 years Weight: 42 lbs Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, spayed and heartworm positive but treatment is paid for and underway. Temperament: dog selective and needs slow intro, good with older respectful kids (no experience with small kids to know). Training, House trained, crate trained, knows commands Sit and Wait.

Hector is currently in home boarding as we continue to search for his forever home. His caretaker says he's charming and she loves having him around.

Hector was a county shelter dog adopted by someone nearby. Despite being found roaming and returned to his adopter many times, Hector's resilience shone through. The last time he was loose, he walked himself to the shelter and asked to come in. We can do better for Hector and must make it happen. We have been working on Hector's home for over a year now!

Please contact ADOPTION (adopt@doggieharmony.org) for more information about this pet.Meet Chai, the pocket-sized ball of sunshine and enthusiasm! This adorable pooch is small but mighty, with a constant grin and a cute little underbite when she is focused. The best part? She's a social butterfly and loves making new friends with humans. She loves strutting her stuff around town, and soaking up all the love and attention she can get.

Chai's story is one of perseverance. She was rescued from animal control by a loving owner, but faced discrimination from her condo community. However, thanks to a sponsored training program, she's blossomed into an obedient and clever pup. She's mastered the art of walking on a leash (mostly), but her inner hunter still gets her riled up by squirrels and small speedy critters. She just needs a firm hand to guide her.

Spending time with Chai is like taking a shot of pure joy. She's got a spunky personality that's contagious, and her petite frame and cute little legs make her all the more endearing. She's like a cup of chai tea - a sweet treat for those who appreciate her zesty spirit!

Penny is a sweet and gentle old lady. She is very good with dogs and kids and is very low energy. She walks best on carpeting or hardwoods with a lot of area rugs that offer her stability. She does well in the car but needs help getting in and out. She still has some spunk and will play for 5 minutes but then she wants to chill. She enjoys short walks but she is fine just wandering in the back yard also. She stays loose in the house and has never been crated. Her foster leaves for work for 8.5 hours everyday. She is non-destructive, but she was having some stress when left alone so she is taking trazadone daily to help with this. She comes when called. She knows her name. Her hearing is not the best but she can definitely hear you.

Age: 13 years Weight: 65lbs Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, spayed and heartworm negative Temperament: good with kids, good with dogs . Training: House trained, crate trained,some basic training .

Please contact ADOPTION (adopt@doggieharmony.org) for more information about this pet.Rita is a funny little gal who loves playing and snuggling up to her people. If no one is available for playtime, she is happy to entertain herself by throwing balls and toys up in the air and catching them. She's just the kind of dog that can always put you in a better mood!

Lucky Rita landed at animal control as a stray in the Fall. But by Winter a Good Samaritan plucked her out as a foster and put her through training to make her stand out from the crowd. While in training, she learned to temper her play with other dogs a bit, as she used to have a tendency to get over-stimulated and rowdy.

Over time, Rita has learned how to politely engage with other pups and to pick up on their cues when they're tired of playing. She is very eager to please and learn, so she looks forward to her very own person who can continue to show her the ropes of pet life. Visitors to the home are a little bit stressful to Rita, so at this time we are looking for a child free, low traffic home for her. Rita thrives with routine and few surprises.

As far as love goes, it comes quite naturally to Miss Rita. She is always happy to greet you and lean into you for affection.

Meet Maggie, a furry, fun energizer bunny who craves a loving home with plenty of space to stretch her legs. She's the life of the party and loves getting in on the action, but when she's done, she'll snuggle right up and keep your couch warm.

This cutie is a quick learner and can't resist a good treat. She's a pro on the leash and would be thrilled to join you on long walks, hikes, or even a morning jog. Plus, her active lifestyle makes her a pawsome candidate for agility. When she's not trotting alongside of you, she enjoys solving doggie puzzles and going on snif-faris.

While she wasn't too sure about other dogs at first, Maggie has made huge strides in making furry friends. She loves to play, but can be too energetic for some. So we'd be happy to set up a meet-and-greet with your current pup and our trainer to see if they're a match made in doggy heaven.

Nancy is a real gem. She's friendly with people and mostly ignores other dogs and cats, although she doesn't mind cozying up to them for a snuggle on the couch. She does prefer to be around calmer dogs--no crazy puppy energy for this gal. Nancy has done well with kids too (age 8+ would be best).

Nancy is a low-energy senior dog that prefers to spend most of her time snoozing and cuddling her person. She does get pretty excited for meals and loves to do spins while her food is being prepared. Nancy isn't a big barker but sometimes will bark if you're not paying her attention when she wants it. She is a good co-worker for her foster parents that work from home.

Nancy has limited vision, which really doesn't impact her daily life too much, but it is very important to keep her safe/away from stairs so she does not fall. Nancy has a condition called dry eye that requires daily eye drops and ointment. She also has a partially collapsing trachea that causes her to cough sometimes. It doesn't require treatment but a harness (rather than collar) should always be used when Nancy is on leash. She will also need to be monitored to make sure that no mammary masses reoccur (she had several removed when she came to the rescue, including one that was malignant). Nancy will need regular grooming, about every 2 months, to maintain her healthy coat.

Nancy is house-trained in her foster home when she is on a regular schedule. She will have accidents if she isn't taken outside regularly (typically every 3-4 hours during the day). Nancy sleeps through the night without needing potty breaks.

All in all, Nancy is a very easy girl to take care of and you can't help but love her when you meet her!

Mac is a very sweet pittie-labbie boy whose owner is being deployed in February and needs to find a new home for him.

We took Mac into our rescue in 2022 directly from the Cobb shelter, where he had been surrendered as part of an eviction. He's had a good and happy home since then, and has proved to be the smart snuggle buddy we knew he could be! His owner reports that he is great with kids and adults, is well-behaved and can be left on his own in the house without any shenanigans. At a little over six years old, Mac is at the perfect adult dog stage - he's happy to go for a walk or a car ride, but he's equally happy to snuggle and watch TV.

Mac isn't great with other dogs, so a home where he can be the only dog is ideal.

His owner ships out in February 2025, so we are looking for placement for him ASAP."

Maggie was one of our Tree Litter puppies and is seven months old and 18 lbs.

Maggie has one of the most diverse Dog DNA reports we've ever seen, with traces of Jack Russell Terrier, Boxer, Pitbull Terrier, Poodle, Dachshund, Cattle Dog and Husky in her! She is a blend of high energy breeds and needs a fenced in backyard and active owners who want to take her on all the hiking, running and walking adventures she thrives doing.

This girl is house- and crate-trained, knows lots of commands and tricks, and is so very smart! We don't anticipate her getting much bigger than 20 pounds.

Maggie is curious and a little shy around little kids, but would love some human siblings to run around with. We'd recommend a home with kids ages 8 or older so that Maggie can learn new house rules from all of her humans. Additionally, Maggie lived in an apartment complex and the many sounds, people, dogs, and other stimulus was too much for her. Preference will be given to potential adopters in single family homes.

Maggie is fostered in a home with two larger dogs. She plays with them but it took a lot of time and patience to successfully integrate her. We have her listed as needing to be an only dog, but encourage experienced dog owners with a playful dog to consider meeting Maggie!

If you've wanted a running or walking partner, scoop this girl up! She will melt your heart."

Dakota was left by his owner at the county shelter and we couldn't resist his ears so now he's with LLOV!

Dakota is a young adult dog, under 5 years old, and is 20 pounds. He can be a little shy around men but he's warmed up to his foster dad in record time, so love and patience is the way to win him over.

Dakota gets along great with other dogs and loves a very active playmate - the energy packed into his little body is impressive. He'll fit right in with any pack.

Ridley was adopted from the rescue when he was just a puppy. Through no fault of his own, he finds himself back here, looking for his forever home. This sweet boy was very loved and well-trained but his world is a little upside down right now since his dad fell on hard times.

Ridley is a big hunk of love. He is a tall drink of water who is past puppy age, but not quite middle aged or senior. He's a fantastic snuggler. He does well on a leash, but sometimes, Squirrel! Dog friendly. And extremely handsome, if looks are important. Ridley is not a fan of small-child energy so we are looking for a home where the kids are at least 12 years old. A fenced yard would be great - he loves to wander the yard and get all his sniffs in.

Bertie is a gorgeous Livestock Guardian Dog (LGD) mix we rescued from a rural shelter. Bertie is young, probably right around one year old, and will probably be around 50-60 pounds when she's filled out.

Bertie is a project dog. She is still very shy and anxious, but we believe in a quiet home with a fenced in yard, she could really thrive. She needs a family with patience and a willingness to take time to train and exercise her. You will be rewarded with couch snuggles and kisses, as once Bertie warms up she is a true velcro dog - her favorite place to be will be by your side.

LGDs are typically pack dogs and like to ""work in pairs"" so having another dog is a MUST HAVE to ensure Bertie's success. Experience with nocturnal guardian dogs is major plus, too.

Our entire rescue loves Bertie and we know you will, too! Give her a chance to brighten up your family and you won't have any regrets."

Remy is about a year old (exact age unknown), around 45lbs, and is in his adolescent phase! He is very affectionate and playful, always looking to engage with a human or his current foster brother in whatever game is possible. He is infinitely curious about everything which makes him easy to entertain with toys and treats!

Remy's breed mix makes for a dog needing lots of exercise to expend energy, and he benefits from multiple walks a day and playtime outside with other dogs or playing fetch. He would be a great running or hiking buddy!

Remy is coming to us house and crate-trained, but his previous owners report he is the first one up in the morning - potty, breakfast, then snuggles. Sounds like a perfect morning to us.

Rocho is fun, affectionate, and the best cuddler with the softest fur. He is 2 years old and 62 pounds of love!

Rocho gets along with every dog he meets. In his previous foster home, he lived wonderfully with SIX young kids. Currently, he resides with two teenagers and loves to be their sidekick.

Rocho landed in a crowded shelter due to a neglect situation and after some months found himself on the euthanasia list for space. Luckily, his foster family saw what a sweet boy he was and saved him.

Rocho is house trained. He sleeps all night in his crate without any fuss and will even go in on his own when he is tired. He has excellent car manners and loves to go for rides. He is working on not pulling so much on the leash when he sees another dog. He just gets too excited!

Rocho really wants to please his humans and loves to hear praises and get rubs. He is also very food motivated which makes training easy. He knows sit, stay, down, and leave it.

Rocho loves to fetch and loves toys. He will often choose a toy to take on a walk with him and keeps up with it. He will also play by himself with a toy and stay entertained quite a while and at the same time his antics can keep you entertained! He precious laying on his back and holding a toy in the air above his own head or tossing a ball for himself. Rocho is a silly boy who would love to find his forever family.

She wants to play, but still isn't exactly sure how, and could use someone to teach her the basics. She would do well in a home where she can run around a yard and also go on walks for quality time and exercise. Really, she just needs a forever home that will love all of her!

Don't let Camacho's name fool you. He has a muscular build befitting a macho man (or dog) but in reality, is a ladies' man who is especially fond of woman and children. He's a two-year-old, 50-pound pup with a smile that stretches from ear to ear. With his cheesy grin, he might just be the cutest wiggle-butt you'll ever meet!

Camacho came into the shelter after being abandoned and seized. He had a shock collar on so who knows what his life was like before he was picked up. He does shy away a little bit from men however his foster is male and reports that Camacho is very sweet and affectionate.

Camacho spent practically 6 months in a shelter euthanizing for space until he went into a foster home. His foster reports that Camacho knows down and no and is an obedient pup. They are working on some other commands as well as not pulling on the leash but all in all, Camacho is a good little guy and a pleasure to foster. He's friendly with other dogs and enjoys playing with another dog in his foster home. He does well with older kids in the home, kids that can give him commands. Volunteers at the shelter adored him, his foster has nothing but praise for him and anyone who meets him can't help but fall in love with him. Camacho can't wait to settle into his forever home, and we can't wait to see him spoiled and get all the love he deserves. What a grin he'll have on his face then!

Age: 5 years Weight: 55 lbs Vetting: Neutered, up to date on vaccines, HW negative, and on prevention. Temperament: Good with older/bigger kids, good with other dogs. Training: House-trained, crate-trained, walks well on leash, knows commands Down and No.

Kya is extremely loving. Outside of her reactivity, she really is a sweet pup. She is perfectly content to lay on the couch with you while read or watch TV. She loves playing tug and playing with squeaky toys. Her favorite activity is sniffing.

Kya is on medication for her anxiety and reactivity, and needs to maintain that, nevertheless, we are looking for a calm, consistent environment for her. Low to no traffic in the home, no kids, no other pets. She is very reactive to other dogs - so maybe a nice fenced yard to play in - or a walking area with no other dog walkers or kids. She does bite when she feels threatened. Not uncommon for small dogs but we want a home that limits her feeling threatened. We are looking for someone who has experience with little reactive dogs.

She is seeing a vet behaviorist and it helps her greatly. Combined with a more calm environment, she should thrive. Her owner will discuss all of that and give you the vet's contact. Ideally this training would be continued.

Kya is crate trained and loves her crate. She is housetrained and has only had one accident when she was ill. She knows several commands, Sit, Come, Leave it. She resource guards but can be redirected with a treat and the command Leave it.

Age: 3 years Weight: 25 lbs Temperament: Best with a calm adult, no pets, no kids Vetting: Spayed, up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative Training: House trained, crate trained, knows several commands.

73361506,Misha Adopter Urgently Needed,German Shepherd Dog,,True,Young,Female,Large,,,,Doggie Harmony,GA627,30030,3,True,True,True,,False,"Decatur, GA",N/A,Yes,Special needs.,"Meet Misha Adopter Urgently Needed
Loves kids, good with cats and dogsMisha is not just a beauty, she is also very sweet, submissive, playful, smart, and high-energy. She loves everyone - adults, kids, dogs and cats - and would do best in a home with another dog or some active kids/adults that will keep her engaged. Misha is very playful and can be a vocal communicator, but she is also very respectful of other animals' boundaries and is nonreactive when checked - she was even attacked by a cat once that did not take kindly to her barking, and Misha's response was to run away!

Misha was found tied to RR tracks in Atlanta in August 2023, emaciated and abandoned. She was taken in by a loving family that included a cat and a toddler, but they were never able to get Misha to a healthy weight. Eventually, she was diagnosed with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency, which means that her body does not produce an enzyme that she needs to properly digest and metabolize her food.. This is not uncommon in shepherds but it can be very expensive to treat, and unfortunately Misha's original rescuer could not afford her care so she came to Doggie Harmony in September 2024.

After trying out several pancreatic enzyme options (both in her former home and after coming to us), we discovered that the only treatment that seems to work for Misha is Viokase-V, a powdered supplement that must be added to each of her meals. In just the first month of being on this treatment, Misha has gained 12 lbs, but she still has more to gain before she reaches her ideal weight.

PLEASE BE ADVISED that the monthly cost for Viokase-V is ~$600, so any potential adopter must be ready to commit to this cost to maintain Misha's health! She will need to be on this supplement for the rest of her life.

Additionally, Misha has been recently diagnosed with atypical Addision's disease, and needs to be on a low dose of Prednisone daily for life as well. The cost of this treatment is minimal, thankfully.

Despite Misha's high-maintenance medical needs, she is a wonderful dog brimming with potential! She knows basic commands (come, sit, stay) and has the potential to learn much more with a little training. She has good recall, rides well in the car, and is good on the leash as well. She loves toys but does not tear them up, and she has shown the same respect for household items. She especially loves to play fetch, but you may need 2 balls to play with since she often will not drop the one she retrieves until you offer up another one to replace it. In short, she's a great dog and would make an excellent family pet; she just needs a family that can commit to maintaining her health via this Viokase supplement.

Jake is a sweet, cuddly lovebug looking for his forever home. We believe Jake to be no more than two years old. He is super playful and high energy. He can run 3 miles in 21 minutes! His i

deal home would be with someone who runs or hikes and wants a four-legged partner in crime for their adventures.

He also loves to walk and run on the treadmill. He gets along great with other dogs, especially those who have high energy like him and like to wrestle and play rough.

H

e'd be an amazing agility dog if anyone is looking for that.

He can sit, lay down and high-five (his personal favorite). He can also ""sit and wait"" for his meals or to be let out of his crate. Jake is SUPER food motivated and eager to please, so he is very trainable. As food motivated as he is, he has zero resource guarding. He doesn't even resource guard his toys and those are his second favorite thing in life right behind cuddles. H

e loves toys! He always wants to have a toy in his mouth.

He is house broken and has gone up to 10hrs before with no accidents!

He does still pull on the leash, but with the proper collar and training this will lessen. He is not a fan of cats.

He's not the biggest fan of being crated but he isn't destructive, so he gets to hang out loose in the house when his foster Mom is gone.

He is a super snuggle bug and he loves to be on top of you. H

e also grunts when he is happy! Are you his new family?

Please contact ADOPTION (adopt@doggieharmony.org) for more information about this pet.
Patsy is on her second adoptive home. Though we all hoped differently, it's more like a misfit sock than a cozy pair! She is looking for a new foster or adoptive home ASAP!

Patsy absolutely shines as an only pet in an adult home with a daily dose of exercise, which is what she had in her first adoptive home. Tragically her first mom sadly left this world way shut too soon, leaving Patsy alone in the home feeling confused and uncertain.

Patsy is 35 pounds of sassy sweet fun! She gets along well with male dogs and can tolerate female dogs who accept her assertive nature. But she really seems to thrive best as the only dog and 'child' in the home - she got used to being the center of some loving pet parent(s) world.

Right now, she may feel like a deer in headlights in a bustling house full of kids or furry pals. There have been some cheeky incidents, like a little nip at a neighbor kid on a bike and a some squabbles over toys and food with other her dog roommate.

We believe she's a mix of border collie intelligence and Jack Russell bravado. These breeds require someone who is willing to keep up on her training and provide structure - she doesn't need to run the house. She will actually be a happier dog if she knows her person is in charge.

What Patsy really dreams of is a home that mirrors her first happy digs! Think you could be the perfect match? Give us a shout!

loves kids, loves kisses and lapsSweet Rosie was abandoned at a church. She was around a lot of kids who were out playing after church and she was very peaceful with them. She has clearly been abused but despite her experience, she is the most loving, gentle lady.

She is fine around other dogs, non-confrontational. She has not been cat tested. She is in a kennel right now so we don't know about house-training yet. She loves treats so she should be easy to train though.

While she is fine with kids, I'm going to say older kids only because she does flinch with sudden movement, but has never shown reactivity or aggression. She actually is a kissing fiend and can't get enough affection. She is a big lap dog.

Please contact ADOPTION (adopt@doggieharmony.org) for more information about this pet.A kind soul took in Keanu after he was abandoned at a church. He was very polite with all the kids gathered around, so she thought this pup seemed destined to be a family guy!

Keanu is very social and loves being with his people/dog pack. His heart is open to those who share his love, but he's not a fan of the feline kind. He loves cuddles, head scratches, and going for runs, so he'd pair well with a moderately active person/people who can give him adequate one-on-one time and space to run.

Keanu is a gentleman who appreciates dogs that respect his space. His usual reaction is to ignore them or try to play with them. He could live with another dog, especially if they're more submissive. However, he does need to be fed separately.

He's cautious with new people at first, gets timid when they get close, but then booty shakes and licks. He could use some training but nothing major at all (typical puppy things- humans aren't chew toys, pulls on leash). He does great in a crate. Potty trained, no accidents in house. He is a shadow dog and always wants to be wherever you are.

Prince has one abnormal eye. We asked about removal and actually requested it at neuter if they thought we needed to. The doctor chose not to remove it. It is not causing him any pain or discomfort, purely cosmetic. That was the opinion of two doctors from two different vet practices. We don't think he can see out of that eye, but it does not bother him at all, cause any pain/discomfort, and drs didn't think we needed to remove.

Ahoy there! SeaBiscuit here, looking to sail away to a good home! Landlubbers say I have gorgeous coloring and am rather unique looking (I would say aye to that.) I narrowly escaped being euthanized for space at an overcrowded shelter but a kind family saw my photo and decided to foster me. Talk about lucky!! Here are a few things to know about me. I am an energetic mate but settle down quickly. My fosters say I just melt into them and can't get enough cuddling and snuggling. I am good with their teenage daughter and love her so much. I am friendly, playful, fun, know sit, give kisses, affectionate. I am house trained and crate trained. I know sit, lay down commands and I am working on touch, focus, turn, and stay commands. What else do you need to know? I have enjoyed the company of other dogs at the shelter and am trying to make friends with the dog in my foster home, except he's taking his time to get to know me. I was going to put this message in a bottle but people tell me the internet is faster. So, please consider me, SeaBiscuit and allow me to sail into your home and heart!

Rizzo is a high energy and playful pup. He's a ball of energy that loves his people. He's very smart and obedient.

He was rescued from a chained situation where he broke free and was found running in traffic in Tucker. He does have a scar on his neck, most likely from being chained. He was taken to the shelter where he developed pneumonia. A foster brought him home to in November to help him recover. The vet gave him a 50/50 chance of survival. He's a fighter and he did survive. Now he deserves a wonderful home.

He is 100% American Staffordshire Terrier but he is small like a pocket pittie. Rizzo can be playful and mouthy like a puppy. He needs a patient owner willing to work with his puppy behaviors and continue training. He also has a medical condition known as a collapsing trachea. For this reason, Rizzo can't take long walks on a leash even with a harness.

He's nervous around new people but only in the home. He can be protective of his people in the house but is great outside of the home meeting new people.

He loves to play in the yard. He loves having lots of toys to squeak and play with and he loves having unlimited supplies of cow ears and bully sticks.

He has no resource guarding issues and he isn't destructive in any way. He is great with dogs and cats and would love to live with another dog with a similar play style.

He does need a fenced yard to run around in so he can get his energy out. He can't be outside for long periods of time in the Summer due to his collapsed trachea.

Housebroken, but he needs to go outside first thing in the morning before you even brush your teeth.

Age: 2 years Weight: 46 lbs Vetting: Up-to-date on vaccines, neutered and heartworm negative and up to date on vaccines Temperament: good with bigger kids and other dogs. Training: House trained and knows how to use pee pads. For questions, please email

Hi -

My name is Pear. I was dumped in a box in someone's backyard when I was about 8 weeks old. My finders knew who to call and contacted my current foster mom. DOB EST 08/04/2024


I love to play outside with my giant Foster brother who is a 98lb German Shepard and boy do I give him a run for his money.

I chase him around the yard, try to eat from his food bowl but he doesn't like that and so I now eat from my own bowl next to him. I play with chew ropes and chase him around the yard trying to get his toy from him.

I cannot go just anywhere because of my breed, a lot of places say I am not allowed to be there. So if you are interested in adopting me you will need to submit an application.

If you rent, you will need to bring proof you have paid your pet deposit, and that I am not on the breed restriction list, and that if I go over a certain weight, I can stay. This will need to be the same thing if you own your home and live in an HOA as they have a breed restriction list as well.

Also, check with your renters and homeowners insurance as they also have breed restrictions as well.

You must know my breed because we can be silly but we are strong so people like to use us for bad things, and I really don't like that for us because I just want to snuggle and get all the loves that I can get.

Please know that just because you submit an application on me does not mean that you will be chosen to be my forever family. My foster mommy is so picky on who can adopt me because she wants the absolute best for me and I am so happy that she does.

She says that my new home will have to spoil me rotten and treat me like the princess that I am.

I am working on house-breaking and I am almost there but I am still just a baby and will have accidents at times.

My foster mommy says that I cannot go into a home with small children because I may hurt them on accident with how I play bite and might scratch them when I jump on them. Please know that this does not make you a bad home, this is for my safety and the safety of your little ones."

LOCATION: Atlanta, Georgia
DOB: 01/20/2024

Dallas Blackjack is a 10-month-old male Doberman/Giant Schnauzer/Shepherd mix who is looking for his forever home. This cutie was returned due to his owners moving, but he’s ready to find a new family to love.

Dallas would be perfect for someone who enjoys outdoor adventures like hiking, running, and road trips. He thrives on activity and needs an outlet for his high energy levels. Currently, he enjoys walking 2 miles twice a day.

Dallas is a pro with other dogs and would love to have canine companions in his new home. He’s curious about cats, sniffing and wagging his tail, but the cat in his current home isn’t a fan, so they don’t interact much. We can’t say for sure if Dallas is trying to make friends or just curious. He loves children and has met kids as young as 2 without showing any signs of discomfort. He does still puppy play mouth and can jump, but he has no aggressive tendencies.

Dallas is house trained, crate trained, and leash trained. He also completed a 4-week basic obedience class. If adopted locally, he comes with a lifetime membership to Harvard K9, which has already been covered. Dallas stays off furniture and doesn’t chew on things. He will alert you if someone is at the door, so combined with his need for yard zoomies, apartments might not be the best fit for him.

This fantastic guy will make a great family member. If you’re interested in giving Dallas Blackjack a loving home, please let us know!

Courtesy Post: Owner Surrender/Rehoming- Atlanta, GA

Meet Hudson Fox! He is an 2 year old Australian Shepherd/Australian Cattle Dog mix and weighs between 45-50 lbs. He is neutered, microchipped, up to date on shots, and on heartworm prevention. Hudson Fox is nervous around strangers! He hasn’t been tested around kids. He is good with cats! No dogs, due to his reactivity! He is housebroken and crate-trained.

Hudson Fox has bitten 3 people. He bit the owner in May 2023 when they attempted to put a muzzle on him while at the vet clinic. He bit the owner’s friend on the hand in May 2024 when meeting him for the first time. Hudson Fox also bit the owner in October 2024 when they attempted to clean his paws after he had an accident in the house. The owner is surrendering him because of his severe anxiety. He also needs an environment with a fenced-in yard, so he can run. He needs to go ASAP!

If you think you can provide a great home for Hudson Fox, please contact the owner listed below. There is a $100 rehoming fee to assure good folks with good intentions. This fee will be donated to Australian Shepherds Furever for their assistance in placing Hudson Fox.

ATHENA- Foster or Foster to Adopt ?

Location: Jefferson, Georgia
Transport options available

Spayed female, 1.5 years old
Reason for rehoming: HIGH PREY DRIVE
Dane/Lab mix possibly?

Athena is not cut out to be a homestead sort of girl. She has a huge prey drive and is causing the family to lose ducks and rabbits. We are looking for a no cat and no small dog home. She DOES love to play with bigger dogs. She is VERY energetic. Seems fine with kids. Crate and house trained. Must have physically fenced yard for zoomies.

ADDITIONAL BEHAVIORAL NOTES FROM OWNER: She wants to constantly cuddle on the couch (and feels a bit entitled to it). Very affectionate, but also gets jealous if other pets are getting more attention than her. She LOVES to run and will run laps around our back yard until she wears herself out.
I have trained her to obey sit/lay down/stay/spot (place)/bed (crate). She knows to sit patiently while being given food or water and will wait until I say ""okay"" before going for it. She was very consistent with commands, but is going through a sort of teenage rebellious phase right now where she sometimes seems to not hear us.

Athena will be a great pup for an active family! She does decent on leash and would likely make a great companion for outdoor sporting adventures. Please let us know if you can foster her!

Meet Shorty (aka Martin Shorty)

Are you looking for a tiny companion? Full grown and only 12 pounds, meet Shorty, a Chihuahua/Dauchand mix who’s ready to find his forever home! With his adorable look—one ear perked up, the other flopping down—he’ll steal your heart at first glance!

About Shorty:
We believe Shorty is 2-4 years old. He's had some bad luck recently. He came to us from a home where his elderly owner became ill and could no longer care for him or his K-9 companions. When change came, Shorty was hesitant to leave the only world he knew, bravely venturing into the great outdoors. In other words, he escaped from the house! After several days of confusion, we were able to earn his trust and move him into a loving foster home, where he is getting everything he needs, especially rest and love.


Personality:
Shorty is initially shy around new people and places but is starting to come out of his shell. He follows his foster mom from room to room, and likes to lie close by. He gets along well with other dogs and cats and has so far displayed a calm demeanor.

The Basics:
Health: Neutered, microchipped, heartworm-negative, and up-to-date on vaccines, deworming, flea/tick, and heartworm prevention. He’s also had a nail trim—he’s looking sharp and feeling great!

House Training: Shorty has adapted well in his foster home, following the big dogs outside to potty and has had only one accident. While we can’t guarantee perfection in a new environment, he’s off to a great start.

Ideal Home:
Shorty is looking for a patient and loving family who will allow him time to adjust to his new surroundings. He would thrive in a quiet home where his people appreciate his independence and give him space to be himself. A home with friendly pets would be a bonus!

Please not that we do not know the breed of Shorty. Only suspect chihuahua/dachshund based on physical appearance.

To apply for adoption, please go to www.animalaidms.org/adopt and complete our online application. If your application is approved and you're a great fit for this dog, we will reply with a phone call.

Note: Please submit an application through our website at link above. We need that actual application and not simply a Petfinder inquiry. Be sure to complete the entire application as incomplete applications will not reach us.

Shorty is located in South Mississippi. We conduct virtual meet and greets for out-of-town applicants and can provide for transport (fee added to cost of adoption) to many northeastern states. At this time we are not able to transport into Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine or Rhode Island.

FOSTER HOME NEEDED ASAP PLEASE!
His life was spared before the freeze. He was found running in the middle of the street 3 days before Christmas. He was so grateful, he came right up to the good samaritan's car and jumped in! That night the temps dropped below freezing. His ribs were showing, and when he was given food, he scarfed it down.
Now he's happy as a lark, good with other dogs. He's estimated at 1 year and still growing. He loves every person he meets. He's housebroken and crate trained. He's learning house manners and is a great candidate for obedience. He's very loving and will follow you around the house sticking to you like velcro. He's ready Freddy, so come see about him. He prefers to have a 6 foot privacy fence, or someone who walks him. He's very agile, and thinks a small fence allows him to practice his agility.
UPDATE: He'll do great with a runner. He's very active and would enjoy the exercise. So if you're looking for a running partner, he's your man!"

This is Lady Bug, a patterdale mix less than a year old. Lady Bug's origin story is truly horrific...a neighbor heard a gun shot next door in the middle of the night and went out to investigate. The man next door was heavily intoxicated and shot his own puppy in the jaw. The man was yelling obesentities that he was going to go ahead and kill the puppy and the neighbor begged him not to, that they would take the puppy. The man agreed but said if the puppy ever came back he would ""finish the job"". The neighbors took the puppy and would like to have kept her but were worried about her safety should the man spot her again. They brought her to us. Poor Lady Bug must have been in inscrutiating pain -her jaw was barely hanging on. Depsite that, her tail never stopped wagging and she allowed our vet to stitch her up so she could recover enough to endure a more permanent solution. About 6 weeks later, Lady Bug underwent intense surgery to fix her jaw permanently. Thankfully the surgery was a complete success -other than some scars, you would never know what had happended to her, she has made a full recovery and is now looking for her happy ending! Lady Bug is super friendly and energetic. She needs to go to an active home - she would make a great jogging partner for someone! She loves everyone she meets but she might be too much for very small children -she would never do it on purpose but she might accidently knock a very small child over. Older children would be great! She is also good with other dogs, untested with cats. Lady Bug is up to date with shots, negative for heartworms/on prevention, spayed and crate trained.

This handsome guy is King, a boxer/mastiff mix around 2 years old. He and 7 other dogs (including Precious who is also up for adoption) were confiscated by animal control for cruelty and neglect. They were all living on short chains with no access to water or shelter and they were only being fed sporadically. We have ""before"" pictures of him -he was nothing but skin and bones, filthy dirty and full of hook worms and fleas. Despite this, his tail never stopped wagging -he seems to be very grateful to have been saved. After being treated for everything and being fed high quality food multiple times a day, King is now healthy and at a good weight and is down to just one meal a day. King is really a nice dog but at this time, we are going to recommend he be an only dog. Because he was bascially starved almost to death, he needs to be fed carefully and should be adopted by someone who can handle a strong dog. He is very friendly but we do not know how he would react if he felt threatned by another dog, especially if there was food around. For this reason, we are also not recommending him for a home with small children. This could easily change over time where he wouldn't feel the need to resource guard but there is also the chance he might always feel the need to do this. He suffered a trauma and is honesly, lucky to be alive. We really believe he will thrive in the right home.

The sweetest senior beagle ever is looking for a family he can love on during his golden years! Chester was picked up as a stray at about 12 years old but it was clear he was cared for at some point, and he is just so grateful to have a comfy bed again. He is extremely chill, and settled peacefully into a household with multiple dogs of varying ages and personalities.

He loves naps, tushy scratches, ear rubs and leisurely strolls.

With his age does come some mobility issues – although he can navigate textured stairs, he would be best suited to a household where he did not have to do a lot of climbing. And he does have an “old man bladder” so needs consistent potty breaks.

We’ll be honest with you, this will likely not be a long-term commitment on the part of an adopter. But he has been fully vetted – he had a dental as well as bloodwork and does not have any chronic conditions. Chester brings his foster family such love and joy, and it is impossible not to look into that sweet face and just want to love on him for whatever time he has left.

If you’re looking for a friendly, fun, super affectionate pup, Russ is your guy!

Russ is an approximately 6 month old 20 lb, maybe beagle, maybe Jack Russell Terrier mix who has done great with the other dogs and elementary aged kids in his foster home.

He’s had no accidents in his crate or in the house but he is still a puppy and he does get frequent potty breaks, so a home where that can continue is a must. He’s not accustomed to pottying on a leash, so a home with a fenced in yard is preferred.

While Russ can be very playful, he’s also very affectionate and loves cuddling up with his foster family on the couch for movie time.

Meet Sweet Tygra Girl - Foster or Forever Home Needed ASAP!

Tygra is a loving, sweet-natured dog who needs your help! Her temporary foster family can no longer keep her, and she's in urgent need of a foster or forever home. To make fostering easier, we'll provide all her needs and even offer $150/month to her foster family.

Why You'll Love Tygra:

Loves People: She's a big lap sitter who adores human companionship.
Cuddly & Devoted: The perfect snuggle buddy who will always stay by your side.
Playful Personality: Enjoys toys, car rides, and walks.
Great on Leash: Walks beautifully and will be your walking partner.
Kid-Friendly Sleeper: Sleeps quietly with children all night.

Tygra's Story

Tygra has been through so much. Found abandoned with another dog, tied to a short rope on a porch, she spent a week in harsh conditions before being rescued by animal control. She was at risk of euthanasia due to overcrowding when a kind family saved her. Unfortunately, the chaos of their busy home with six kids and another dog became too stressful for her, leading to food and toy guarding behaviors. She's just overwhelmed and confused-a calm, quiet home is what she needs to thrive.

Her Ideal Home

Tygra will do best in a home:

With no other pets and few people-ideal for a couple or single person.
Calm and structured-she needs a stable environment to relax.
With a small fenced yard, regular walks, and lots of love.
Dog-savvy owners, especially those familiar with large breeds or Bulldogs.

Tygra will be your loyal couch potato companion and best friend.

Destin is a sweet easy-going girl with a goofy personality. She's listed as nine years old, but that's just a guess from the shelter and she could be younger. Even if she is listed as nine, she has a lot of life in her. As much as she loves to curl up in a ball to sleep, she also loves rolling around in the grass and prancing around with toys. she's been around other dogs, male and female. She can get a little rough when she plays so it's best she's around dogs that are very tolerant and introduced in a proper manner. She came from a sad past, but she doesn't let that get her down. She finished up her heartworm treatment and is now starting to feel better. She's got the cutest lovable face, Destin has done well in a crate for an extended period of time, is potty trained, and has met kids a various ages. However, she would likely do best with kids eight years old and up.

Duke is a happy go lucky guy who is
about 4 to 5 years old. Duke was abandoned by his family with another dog and left in very poor conditions. After a few baths and some TLC, he's doing so much better in a foster home. He loves attention from anyone, especially if they will give him a butt scratch. He has done well with meeting dogs both male and female, but he has mostly been around female dogs. He housebroken, crate, trained, and has done well with kids a various ages, but would likely do well with children eight years old and up. Duke is mostly very laid-back and calm, but he does get pretty excitable when he knows it's time for food or when he's ready to get out of his crate. He likes to run around in the yard and sometimes play with a ball. But he mostly loves to army crawl on his belly in the grass or roll around in the grass. He's a silly guy that always makes people laugh and would make a great addition to a family!

PREFERRED CONTACT METHOD & INFO: email - ali.mentana@gmail.com
OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOG: Misha has exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and as a result cannot properly digest/metabolize her food on her own. She was found abandoned, tied to the train tracks in ATL in Aug 2023, and was taken in by a good samaritan. Unfortunately, her EPI was not being properly managed in her previous home due to financial constraints (which is ultimately why they had to surrender her), so she is currently severely underweight. She is now being treated with Viokase-V (no other enzymatic supplements we have tried will work for her), and in just 3 weeks of being on that treatment she has gained about 10 lbs, which is excellent, but she's still probably 15 lbs underweight. The Viokase-V supplement has to be given with each meal and has to be prepped in a very specific way - the food has to be moistened by adding a little water, then the powdered supplement has to be mixed in and allowed to 'incubate' for at least 20 minutes before Misha can eat it. She has to get it every time she eats, and therefore she cannot have any treats throughout the day unless they are given within 1 hour after she has a meal with the Viokase.
Misha is also on Fluoxetine (Prozac) daily to manage anxiety, but it is possible that her anxiety was a result of her being in a constant state of starvation/desperation for sustenance that she wasn't getting due to her condition, coupled with the fact that she is a young, high-energy working breed who had not been adequately exercised. Now that she is putting on weight and able to be more active, she does not present any anxious behavior. She may be able to be weaned off of the Prozac once she is at her ideal weight and in a stable permanent home.
Behaviorally, Misha is incredibly smart and super sweet - she knows some basic commands (sit, stay, come, kennel) and is eager to please and would take to additional training very readily. She is good on the leash and in the car, however, she gets very excitable when encountering other dogs on walks and will bark at/pull towards them. This is because she wants to meet/play with them, and we've noticed she's not as insistent about that if she is already walking with other dogs. She is very vocal and will bark to communicate that she wants something - when she's hungry, needs to go out, wants to play, etc. She will play fetch for hours if given the opportunity, but won't drop the ball unless you have another ball in your hand already, so you need to have 2 balls for playtime. She will also bark at other dogs as a way to instigate play with them, but she is very submissive and nonreactive - when another dog gets annoyed by her barking and checks her, she drops to the ground and leaves them alone. She is also very good with cats and kids, and lived with a cat and toddler in her previous home. Misha loves to cuddle and is not go-go-go all day long - there are long stretches throughout the day when she's content to just nap or laze around - but she does get restless if she's been inactive for too long, and she wakes up quite early eager to start the day. She is housebroken for the most part, but can't hold it for extended periods of time (possibly because of her condition - food and water goes right through her) so we crate her when we go out and she does occasionally have accidents in there if we're gone too long. However, as mentioned, she does let us know when she needs to go outside. She has not shown any destructive tendencies in the home and is even gentle with her toys. Overall, she is a really great dog and will absolutely thrive in the right environment. Her ideal home is an active family/individual with a large fenced yard and at least one other dog for her to play with."

Our sweet Noah is another one who came to us after being let down his whole life. Back in the spring he was confiscated at an eviction and taken to a huge metro county shelter. He was pulled by a “rescue” who sadly only wanted him for his pledge money and then was dumped at a boarding facility. The people at the boarding facility fell in love with him, how could you not?!?

Noah is fully vetted and has now completed obedience training with the people who advocated for him. He’s learned his doggy manners and his new adopters will get a free lesson so he can show off what he knows! He’s around 2 ish years old and weighs a little over 50lbs.

Noah has done well with the dogs he’s met with us and has even met a dog savvy cat and done well! (please understand that these cats are very used to dogs. If a cat ran from him he would probably chase it just like most other dogs would). Noah is very food motivated and once he knows you’re the keeper of the snacks, he’s your new instant best friend!

Noah hasn’t met any small children with us so for now at least we’re looking for a home with no small children.

He’s met the dog savvy office kitties where he’s training and has done well with them (please understand that these cats are very used to dogs.

Our handsome Boone was pulled right off the euthanasia list. He loved on his transporter the whole ride to us and has been the best boy!

Boone is fully vetted, around 2 years old and weighs about 57lbs. He can be a little selective about who his dog friends are sometimes, but has done well with most of the dogs he’s met with us. We’re not best friends with every single person we meet either so, we get it buddy!

He is crate trained and has completed basic obedience and will come with a free lesson for his adopters so they can learn all that he’s learned.

Boone is looking for a home with no kids under 8 yrs old.

Thank you for your interest in one of our furry kids! Adopting from Releash Atlanta means you will adopt a dog that has been fully vaccinated, spayed/neutered, microchipped and medically cleared!!

if want to help sweet little Oakley

Oakley is a young, adorable, nearly 2-year old Mini Australian Shephard/Lab mix who is small at 24 pounds. Oakley was with current owner since a puppy but cannot keep as the family is too busy (3 kids and another large dog and cat), and Oakley is not getting the love, care and attention she needs.

Oakley doesn't play with toys too much but does play w/them when her non-sibling brother, Dobie mix, plays w/them and her. She likes running around w/him in their yard. She is a bit docile and submits to pets by rolling on her back for belly rubs.

Oakley would be an easy addition for anyone as she lives w/three children ages (4, 6, & 9 years old), a cat, and a dog, so she's good w/all.

We would like to take this girl in now before she winds up somewhere not so good but need a foster home until her adoptive home is found.

Meet Izzy - PURE AMERICAN BULLDOG FEMALE

~ 3.5 YRS. OLD

METRO ATLANTA AREA

Meet
Izzy
- An adorable Female American Bulldog!

Izzy
absolutely loves her humans and wants nothing more than to be snuggled up against you! As a deaf bulldog, she likes to have her people in eyesight and will delightfully follow you around the house and inquisitively investigate whatever you are doing, because she wants to be a part of it! She loves her late afternoon walks, sniffing, and grunting happily at whatever she's looking at. She's just as happy to curl up at your feet all day: she does not require a lot of exercise and prefers to not be outside when it's hot. She really enjoys playing with sticks outside and likes to chase them but hasn't quite figured out how to let them go. She'll definitely need a nap after playing.

Izzy
LOVES car rides and will happily watch the scenery go by. She occupies herself during the day with her chew toys/bones or just with deeply sleeping at any opportunity. Because she loves lounging/sleeping, she can handle being on her own during a workday. You'll sometimes have to give her a little nudge to let her know you walked in the house, since she is a ""heavy"" sleeper and will not hear you upon entrance. It's really cute. She is such an easy-going fur baby.

She is well house-trained; and if her human is not outside with her on potty breaks, she will run out to do her thing and come right back inside the home. She'll do a little bark to let you know she's ready to come back. She loves her food times and very food focused but will sit and wait until she has permission to eat her food. She's been through some professional training with an emphasis on a few hand signals so that she knows when to sit, give you paw, come to/follow you and when it's time to lay down in bed. She has never had an accident in the house, nor has she chewed on anything other than her toys!

As sweet as she is on humans, other dogs don't make her feel comfortable so she would be best for a family with no pets. She's fine on leash when other dogs are around and won't pay attention to them. As a deaf dog, she doesn't bark often at so would be great in condo living. She has the American Bulldog short nose so she can make some pretty funny noises as she meanders around. She's super comfortable with being touched on her paws (for easy clipping) and even loves being held in someone's arms

Anyone who has met her has marveled at how sweet she is!
Izzy
is an easygoing, lovable girl who deserves her forever home. You can see her adorable personality in the 4 short videos below (3 of those 4 are her training - below).

Meet Bart - BIG sweet, well behaved boy!

This handsome guy is Bart! At about 7 years old, he is at the perfect age to bring home and not have any worries about some of the ""immature"" behavior his younger counterparts might show! Yet, he's still young enough that he's active and fun!

Bart is housetrained, crate trained, and just a nice gentleman in the house. He is also very dog friendly! We haven't seen him with young kids yet, but with his friendly and relaxed nature we will be very surprised if he has any issues with them, or with anyone!

He is a big boy at right around 100 lbs, and could stand to lose a few pounds. If you're looking for a best friend to walk with, take on hikes, to get or stay in shape yourself, you and Bart would be great for each other!!

If you're looking for a ""turnkey"" dog that you can take home and have little if anything to do to help him acclimate (and this is very rare with shelter dogs!) Bart is the one you've been dreaming of! Please apply at the link below if you're interested in learning more about this big sweetie!

Meet Honey! She is as sweet as her name, as well as an exuberant, fun, loving girl!

Honey came to a county shelter with another dog, and sadly had been in and out of the shelter due to being found running at large numerous times. Because of that, Honey and her brother Conan (who we also saved and is available!) were placed on the euthanasia list.

We wanted to save Honey's life, but did not have a foster for her. Thankfully a temporary foster stepped up in the nick of time, but we MUST FIND A NEW FOSTER asap!! If interested, please fill out the foster application at the link below, thank you!

Honey is very dog and people friendly. We are still learning about her as we just saved her on 6/17, so will update with more about her as we get to know her.

We do know that she loves to play in the water and the sand, so if you're looking for a lake or beach dog, Honey is your girl!

If you are interested in her, please fill out an application at the link below, and we will be in touch!

Foster to adopt is also an option!

Zuma is a striking young shepherd mix. This beautiful girl is around 1 year old; she weighs about 60lbs. She's crate trained and is house trained. She has a medium energy level and enjoys cuddles just as much as she loves doing zoomies around a fenced yard! Zuma is best described as playful, silly and sweet. She can take a few minutes to warm up, but then once she's comfortable around you she lets her fun personality shine! She does well with other dogs with proper introduction.

Zuma would love a forever home with a fenced yard or an active family, (she's in foster with children and has done well with them), and a family who will provide her the recourses to continue gaining confidence. Zuma was found abandoned in a city park. This special girl deserves a wonderful home where she will be well loved! Zuma is spayed, fully vaccinated, and up to date on her vaccines."

Hi! I'm Clarabelle. Aren’t I cute?

You may think you know what type of dog I am, but you'll never guess correctly in a million years. I’m actually full-bred couch potato! ?

It doesn’t take much to make me happy, so please don’t put me through the trauma of pretending like I have hobbies. I'm low maintenance and content to simply hang by your side. Adventure? Energy? VIGOROUS EXERCISE? Gross. The only adventure I'm interested in is a trek to the couch for a long winter's nap, thank you very much.

All you really need to know is that I'm a big fan of:
1. Sleeping
2. People
3. Blankets fresh from the dryer
4. Being the little spoon
5. Any combination of items 1-4, especially if snacks are included

See? Low maintenance.

My foster mom also told me to include words like ""sweet"" and ""mellow"" and ""easy going"" when introducing myself. I don't know what any of it means, but if she said it then it must be true.

So, if you’re looking for a ride-or-die BFF who thinks Cheryl Crow’s “If It Makes You Happy” makes a pretty damn good theme song... I’m your girl. In fact, I already love you so much that I’d prefer to be your only fur-child and can picture the matching Christmas PJs we’ll wear together. The photo ops will be endless.


P.S. For the record, I'm NOT lazy! I’ll never say no to an afternoon walk and if you've got good aim, I might even indulge in a game of fetch every now and again. All I’m asking is that you don’t put me down for that multi-day hike in the Everglades your co-worker told you about. I’m sick that day."

Charlotte (otherwise known as ""Char"" or ""Char Char Binks"" around our house) is a good dog. We know that sounds lame, but we mean it in the best way possible.

Charlotte is a damn good dog. The textbook definition of a good dog. The kind of good dog they made our favorite childhood movies about.

Why?

1. Charlotte is silly and sweet, gives excellent hugs, and will always greet you with the world's biggest smile whether it's been a week or five minutes since she last saw you.

2. Char is happiest when hanging out with her favorite humans (even if ""hanging out"" means napping at your feet while you work). There's no doubt she will make an exceptionally loyal BFF for her lucky adopter.

3. Old enough to be past that horrible puppy phase but young enough to enjoy the next 10+ years by your side.

4. Charlotte won't brag on herself, so we will: she's actually an Olympic gold medalist in cuddling. It's true! She just got home from Paris yesterday.

5. Also, that sweet face. Are you kidding? She's to die for.

Charlotte loves her people so much that she won't want to share you with a huge crowd; she's really hoping for a dog-brother but would also be more than happy to keep you all to herself.

Char is spayed, fully vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and completed the AHA-recommended treatment for heartworm disease in full. She's ready to come on home and make you wonder how you ever lived without her."

The many faces of our goofy girl Sage belong in a museum. Have you ever seen a hippopotamus this majestic in your entire life? No, you most certainly have not.

She is one of several recent HW+ dogs saved from animal control. She and her sunny outlook on life clearly missed the memo that heartworm treatment isn't supposed to be fun, and it's with this kind of positivity that Sage tackles just about everything. We think she has a good point-why get stressed when you can be a doofus instead?

If that's something you could use more of on a daily basis, then you're in luck! You don't have to wait a second longer to bring home your new BFF, because this happy-go-lucky house hippo is available for foster-to-adopt while finishing treatment! We'll make it official the second she has her clean bill of health."

Nell came to the rescue with a severely dislocated elbow (beyond repair) and an angry tumor on her lower belly. Her front left leg was amputated and the tumor, which was confirmed to be squamous cell carcinoma, was removed with clean margins.

Nell has adjusted to life on three legs without a problem. Best of all, now that Nell knows she's safe, we get to enjoy her perfect personality. Nell loves to give kisses and isn't stingy with spreading the love-all of her dog AND human friends are blessed with enough open-mouth-tongue-kisses to last a lifetime. We truly are the luckiest.

Medically, we know that the likelihood of the tumor(s) returning is high. Probably more than once. But don't let that scare you! Our vet has assured us that so long as her adopter is comfortable with having new tumors removed as needed, Nell's life expectancy is the same as any other dog.

That's right. Nell gets to live the long, happy, and spoiled life she deserves. And with that, this sweet nugget is available for adoption.

From Nell's foster: ""Nell is without a doubt the easiest foster dog I've ever had. She is completely crate-trained-it's her safe space, and she's more than content to nap there until you get home from work. This house hippo is one giant couch potato that would do anything for a soft blanket and some cuddles. She is dog-friendly and has done well when meeting my (loud) toddlers. She's been spayed, dewormed, microchipped, and is heartworm negative. Her only continuing medical need will be monitoring for new tumor growth and having them removed as they arise."""

More than 500 days have passed since our magical man, Merlin, was rescued from animal control. Admittedly, he was a bit of a hot mess express on the day we met. But even with all of the medical issues we had to tackle, he has always been the most handsome man on the planet.

Here are just a few of the things he overcame:

- Recovered from a raging flea infestation and the brutal skin infection that came with it (along with a number of pressure ulcers and other open wounds)
- Underwent oral surgery to remove multiple fracture canines that had been causing him pain for years
- Completed heartworm treatment and kicked those pesky worms to the curb



He is healthy as a horse, and we love this happy guy with everything we've got.

- Merlin is 8ish years young and 75 lbs of handsome squish
- So unbelievably sweet and full of love, has never met a stranger, and honestly is just happy to be included
- Loves to be outside in the sunshine for both a good game of fetch and an afternoon nap (but especially the naps)
- Favorite things include sleeping, cuddling, playing with his favorite ball, snacks, and chin rubs
- Merlin's foster mom, who couldn't love him more if she tried, often describes him as ""the best boy to ever live and ""as easy going as it gets
- Truly the happiest and goofiest dude to ever live (just look at that face) while still maintaining the composure of a perfect gentleman


Merlin is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, confirmed heartworm negative after completing treatment, and is ready to go with a clean bill of health. Please consider giving him the perfect home to retire in!"

Meet Miss Kacy: a fun, loving, 2 year-old, female Husky mix, who's as sweet as they come!




Kacy is extremely outgoing and has the best personality. She absolutely loves everyone she meets and is a very happy, go lucky girl.

Kacy is extremely smart and listens very well. She will sit, shake and lay down on command. She weighs around 50 pounds, is spayed, current on shots and crate trained.

Kacy doesn't have the thick, fluffy coat of a purebred Husky so that's a lot less dog hair to brush!! She is great in the house and a non-chewer.

Ready to add a fun, loving and spunky girl, who loves walks, car rides and especially belly rubs to your life?

***Kacy needs a fenced yard, a 6 ft wood privacy fence works best.

Montana is a beautiful 1 ½-year-old girl. She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations and heartworm negative. She was found wandering around outside the rescue looking for love. We took her in and noticed that she was limping on one of her back legs from a previous injury, but after a couple of weeks of medicine, she is doing much better!

Montana is the sweetest dog in the world and has never met a stranger. She gets along great with new people, other dogs, cats, children, etc. She loves to play and go on walks, and to be where the people are. 

Right now, Montana is in a foster home. She has adapted to the new home very quickly and is learning fast how to live in a home! She is learning some manners (not jumping up on people) and acclimating well to living with other animals. She has some separation anxiety, but according to her foster, it is getting better the longer they have her. Montana is still young, so she has some puppy energy that comes out occasionally. She is an active dog and would do great with an active family.

A temporary foster says that Callum excels in homes with structure and is a delightful companion. Callum will happily snuggle up with you in bed, keep watch while you work, and entertain himself when you are otherwise occupied. As a plus, Callum is also house-trained and crate trained! He's extremely intelligent and loyal and loves to have jobs to do or puzzles to work through. Treats light up his world, and he is easily motivated by food. Bring on the Pupperonis and playtime and Callum will be your best friend!

I know all the basics-sit, stay, come-and I'm eager to learn more! You teach me, I'll catch on fast. Plus, it's a good way to earn some tasty treats, right?

I'm a medium-energy dude, so I'm not going to be bouncing off the walls all day (unless there's a squirrel involved, but we can work on that). I'm happy to go on a walk, play a little fetch, and then chill out for some couch time or just hang out with you. I'm all about balance - a little adventure, a lot of affection.

If you're looking for a dog who's not only well-mannered but also a super-fast learner with a gentle soul, I might just be your perfect match. I'm ready to share my loyalty, love, and, of course, my amazing leash skills with the right person."

Otto is a sensitive soul who struggled mightily in the shelter and is THRIVING in his foster home. Open your home (and lap) to Otto and discover a lifetime of tail wags and love!

Overview

Dachshund mix puppy Sam is looking for a new lap to lay in.

Sam is a sweet little guy

who loves to be on your lap so much that's the only thing he doesn't want to share

. He's almost a year old, and weighs 11 lbs. He

was left at a boat ramp when Little Paws took him in, so he's had a pretty sad start. We are sure this young pup's next move will be a happy one.

Environment

Sam is an easygoing little guy looking for a family to call his own. He's very much still a puppy and has that puppy energy so he will need walks, play, and stimulation. He doesn't

need

a backyard, but if he had one he would make the most of it. In the meantime, he's doing a great job learning to potty on pee pads or walks. He also loves his crate, and doesn't have accidents in it. He's a pretty chill dude once he's settled in, and fine to be left alone when needed.

Pets & People

Sam is great with new people, he likes to snuggle and play, and occasionally hide your shoes. His only kryptonite is small children so he will need a home with older kids or none. With other dogs he's sweet, and even politely suppresses his foodie nature so as not to steal their food.

Location

Sam is available for adoption from Atlanta, GA and he is great in the car. Please email bcozz2152@gmail.com with any questions or complete an adoption application at the button above. The adoption fee for Sam is $450.00."

Meet Eugene, an adorable Cavalier/Maltese mix! Eugene is two and a half years old and weighs about 12 pounds. He was surrendered to Tiny Paws by his previous family because, after having another baby, they felt they could not give him the time and attention he needs and deserves.

Eugene is sweet and calm. He has quickly fallen for his foster mom and loves being her little shadow around the house!

Eugene is crate-trained and house-trained. He had to be shaved by our groomer due to matting but once his long coat begins to grow back out, he will require regular brushing and trips to the groomer.

This gorgeous girl is a Lab (or maybe a mix), about 2 years old with a shiny black coat. Sadly, her life before us wasn't great. She probably lived outside, tied up or in a pen, having litter after litter. She's already had two or three. And yes, she's heartworm positive, but we've got that covered!

Bama, formerly known as Confetti, spent over two months in an overcrowded shelter, and she was likely close to being on the dreaded list. But we couldn't let that happen. We said, ""She's coming with us!""

During Bonding Week, we gave her toys, and she didn't know what to do with them at first.

But she's learning, gaining confidence each day, and bonding with the men. She was a bit unsure about them when they first met, but now she's warming up, and already has some favorites! She even had her first little bounce chasing a ball!

At 68 pounds, Bama is going to make a wonderful family dog by the time she graduates. She might find young kids a bit overwhelming, but some older kids to play with and snuggle up to? That sounds perfect for her."
73538544,Luna,American Bulldog,,True,Adult,Female,Medium,,,,Canine CellMates,GA809,30318,3,,,,,False,"Atlanta, GA",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Meet Luna
We don't know much about Yang's story before the shelter, but her body told us enough to know it wasn't a good one. When we met this incredibly sweet girl, she was stained redddish brown on all four legs, her entire abdomen, including the underside of her tail, and under her chin. Not dirty - well, yes dirty - but stained. This, along with her endearing social awkwardness, indicates a dog that spent her life tethered, in the red clay. She was very thin, very dirty, had been used for breeding, and was heartworm positive. Not much had gone right in her life, but she was oh-so-sweet! So we pulled her, with the plan of getting her back to her beautiful healthy self, and then putting her through the program.

Luna has now completed the training program, and is ready to be forever-loved. This beautiful American Bulldog mix weighs just over 50 pounds - kind of a perfect size - and would love to chin-nibble her way into your heart! If beautiful snow white girls, with a heart of gold

are your cup of tea, you might want to get an application in for this delightful girl!

Luna is in Atlanta, and has completed training in the Beyond The Bars program. She can be adopted at any time, and will be available to go to her new home as soon as she is adopted. If you are interested in this beauty, or any of her Beyond The Bars classmates, the process starts with an adoption application. They can be found on our website -

G.G., formerly known as Mishka, is a young (around 10 months) mastiff boxer mix. Kind of like you took a boxer head, and put it on a mastiff body - lol! But the most adorable mix, and a gorgeous brindle coat, and an underbite, just in case she wasn't already cute enough!

G. G. was a little shy at the shelter, but that didn't last long once we moved her to our facility! She has blossomed into a confident, adorable girl who is already learning with her handler. She is around 70 pounds now, with a little growing yet to do. She will likely land somewhere a little north of 80 pounds, so a large dog, but not a giant one.

If you love silly, cute girlie dogs, we can promise you that you are going to love this one! She would be a great companion for a single or couple, really happy to have another dog as a side kick, and would probably adore having some kids to play with too!"

We think think boy would be an amazing candidate for dog sports! If you've ever wanted to stick your toes in the waters of dog sports, like disc or dock diving, or agility, this boy would be thrilled to learn with you.

He loves all humans, and absolutely LOVES other dogs! This boy is sure to be popular, and we could not be happier to have him in our program! Welcome, Monty!"
73249909,Rocky (GA),Rat Terrier,Chihuahua,True,Adult,Male,Small,,,,New Rattitude - national Rat Terrier rescue,GA558,30318,3,,False,,,False,"Atlanta, GA",N/A,Yes,"Vaccinations up to date, spayed / neutered.","Meet Rocky (GA)
Loyal, feisty 17-lb. Rocky is eager to please, a super snuggle buddy, and very motivated by treats and affection. This rat terrier/Chihuahua mix LOVES to run in the yard, chase his toys, and take long leashed walks. He is also smart and was a star student in his recent training class! He knows many verbal cues like sit, lie down, off, and place. When he needs recharging, he'll seek you out for some cuddling. He is reliably house-trained, rides well in the car, and has nice house manners.
Anxiety about new people and larger dogs, however, is a challenge. They make Rocky bark and appear 'on edge.' A stranger ignoring these signals could get nipped. It has happened before. Rocky can be charming and affectionate and would truly like making new friends, but any potential friend must first slowly earn his trust. And while he generally gets along with dogs his size or smaller, his discomfort around bigger dogs could cause a scuffle if he's not monitored. On walks he ignores calm dogs passing by but lunges and barks at big, energetic ones. Because cats fascinate him and he's driven to chase them, kitties wouldn't make good housemates.
Now 5 years old, Rocky yearns for more space to run, fewer stressors, and lots of positive interaction with his trusted humans. His idea of heaven is a fenced yard and no other animals competing for resources or your attention. In a home with only adults who mostly stay home and have few visitors, Rocky will be happy, devoted, affectionate, obedient, and engaging. That's the real Rocky! And with your determination and love, he'll become your faithful companion for life. Rocky reveals more in his photos at https://imageevent.com/newrattitude/rocky .Our adoption fee is $200 for adult dogs or $250 for puppies under 6 months old.

Freddie is a 2-year-old Morkie, a cross between the Yorkshire Terrier and the Maltese. He is a dog with a heart full of love once he gets to know you. Due to some past trauma, Freddie can be a bit shy at first, but with patience and time, he transforms into a devoted and loyal companion. His favorite activities include playing with toys and being around his trusted humans. Freddie is full of energy, making him the perfect playmate for a home that enjoys fun and interaction.

Freddie is incredibly smart, quickly picking up new things, and is highly motivated by treats, which makes training a breeze. He's working on house training and improving every day!

Freddie gets along wonderfully with other small dogs and is indifferent to cats, except for the occasional curious sniff. He would do best in a home where there is another dog who will be his BFF.

Meet Poppy! She is two years old and weighs 16 pounds. We were told she is a Mini Aussiedoodle — a cross between the Miniature Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Poodle. Poppy was surrendered to us due to her former family not having the time or resources to properly care for her.

Poppy is fluffy and soft and doesn’t appear to shed. She will require regular grooming.

She is sweet with her foster mom, but she is shy when meeting new people. She is quite fearful of men, so if there is a man in the family she will need time and patience to learn that she can trust him.

Poppy would do best in a home with prior dog experience and she would benefit from professional training to help her overcome her shyness. She is crate-trained and house-trained. At this time, we are requiring a fenced yard for Poppy.

She is good with getting bathed and enjoys being brushed.
She is also very food-motivated and will let you know when she wants a meal or a treat!

This is Jake! Here at Tiny Paws, we lovingly call him “Jakey.” He is a sweet senior Chihuahua. He is about 12 years old and weighs 7 pounds.

Jake was found in a crate on the side of the road in a very rural area. He was underweight and his mouth was a mess! Luckily we were able to quickly pull him from the shelter and get him the care he so desperately needed.

Jake is a very loving little guy and is immediately friendly with new people. He is sociable and sweet. He would love a forever home with a lap of his own to curl up in and live out his best years yet!

Meet Otto! He is an 11-month-old Mini Aussiedoodle (Miniature Australian Shepherd / Miniature Poodle mix) who weighs 12 pounds. Otto was surrendered to us when his elderly caregiver, whose son had given Otto to her as a gift, realized she could not provide him with the mental and physical stimulation he needs and that she really would rather have a lap dog.

Otto is a happy-go-lucky little guy with playful puppy energy! He is so smart and we would love to see him go to a home that would dedicate time for him to do agility training or to participate in other dog sports. He loves water and has enjoyed splashing around in the puppy pool at his foster home! He enjoys playing with other dogs and when it’s time to relax, he loves to chill on the couch with his person and cuddle and give kisses.

Otto’s soft, fluffy hair will require regular brushing and grooming. He is house-trained and crate-trained. He would make the perfect new addition to an active household!

Meet Timmy! He is a senior Chihuahua with a big personality. He is estimated to be around 9 years old. He currently weighs about 15 pounds but needs to lose a few of those pounds. We had him fully checked out to make sure he doesn’t have a thyroid issue and our vet said she thinks he just loves food!

Timmy came to us from an overcrowded local shelter. He was scared and in dire need of a dental, so Tiny Paws was happy to take him in and get him the care he needed. Timmy is a funny guy, he is always making his foster mom laugh. He loves to sit up on his butt and wave his front legs to beg for food! We joke and say that he looks like a meerkat, which is how he got his name- Timon (from the Lion King) but we’ve nicknamed him Timmy!

Timmy loves food but LOVES his bed even more. He is crate-trained and loves to lie in a bed inside his crate so that he can reduce the number of dogs trying to get in it!

If you are looking for a sweet (with a little spice), mature dog to keep you laughing and very much entertained -- Timmy might be the perfect fit for you!

Have you heard the news??? Zara is available to be adopted . . . with NO ADOPTION FEE!!

A huge thanks goes to

Animal Legal Defense Fund

for this! Because of ALDF, actress Kate Mara is sponsoring the adoption fee for some of our amazing dogs!

Wow - can you believe it?? You can adopt one of our great dogs, and spend the adoption fee on new toys, soft beds, and yummy treats instead!

ara, named Blyss at the shelter, ended up there when someone called and said there was a dog on their front porch. We don't know if she was lost, or someone had dumped her, but no one came to get her, until we did.

This girl, who we think is a mix of rat terrier, min pin and a little bit of pittie, is a petite girl. She weighed 29 pounds when we pulled her from the shelter, and was a bit underweight, with some filling out to do. She is about 2 years old now, and is at her perfect weight, weighing about 38 pounds. She has a slender little body with long legs, a beautiful red brindle coat, and ears for days! If you have wanted a dog to do dog sports with - like agility - this sweet athletic girl may be a great fit for you!

Like all of our dogs, Zara is in Atlanta. She can be adopted at any time, and will be available to go to her new home when she graduates from the program in mid-December."

Hi, my name is Karen and I am a long-haired Chihuahua and I just recently turned two years old. I weigh about 10 pounds. My favorite thing in the world is chewing on my bone. I also love to sit on the deck and enjoy the weather, riding in the pet stroller and my treats. I am a cuddler and I will sit right next to my mom all day if I could. I don't mind another dog or a cat living with us but I mostly love to hang out with my mom. I'm known for waving and giving high-fives to ask to be pet. Sometimes I stare -- my mom says it isn’t polite but I can't help it. I know how to sit (especially for treats) but I need a little help with my housetraining sometimes. I am very loyal, sweet, funny, and I have very good hearing. I am a bit shy and anxious but once I feel secure and am in a calmer home, I think I'll get better with this. Will you show me the love, patience, and understanding I need?

These comments are from the boarding owner.
Butters and another dog were nose-to-nose on the fence and just wagged tails like crazy. I think they are very similar. They like some dogs not all. And, he probably plays really hard which a lot of dogs react negatively to which might mean Butters should be an only child as he is Selective with whom he gets along with. And NO small dogs and NO cats. Apparently has a HIGH prey drive.

I haven't tried him playing with other dogs yet, but in our play yards he has NOT been fence aggressive with them at all. He's sweet and loving. Climbs in your lap if you sit next to him. Seems to really enjoy affection. Doesn't exhibit any signs of aggression. VERY strong and could use some practice on a leash.

Athena, about 6 yrs. old and such a pretty Lady!! about 65# and uptodate on shots, spayed, HW negative and microchipped.

She was Last Call in a shelter that is small, rural and state governed to kill - although they prefer not to, they have to sometimes.

This Lady was owner surrendered due to her high energy. and not socialized with other dogs and tends to get a little crazy when the dogs start barking!

Athena loves to run and play and loves the baby pool in the summer. She knows the whistle to come in and loves her belly rubs! She's high energy and has her moments of jumping for joy. Now, if you are experienced, the excitement is not vicious, just can't contain her excitement and gets a little crazy. I love her! So happy!!

She loves People and Kids. We are not doing adoption days, and I've never been a fan of Dog Parks - she should not go...if you have a fenced in back yard, kids, she's a great dog. She loves her toys and balls, and the attention from all people and kids!!

AGE: 3 years
WEIGHT: 60 lbs

Akuna was brought to the rescue after she was found with injuries to her neck. We are assuming she was attacked by another dog. A good samaritan found her and brought Akuna to us to take care of her. 

We think when Akuna first came to the rescue, she was very nervous and in a lot of pain. Her neck was extremely swollen and she was sore all over. After antibiotics, pain medication and a lot of love and attention, she has continued to flourish into the wonderful dog she is now. She is a very silly girl with a great personality. Whenever she sees one of the rescue workers go into her room, she immediately jumps up and starts wiggling her big body, asking for pets. 

Akuna is a very sweet dog and loves to go on walks and play with toys. She has a little ball that she loves batting around her room and chasing after. She enjoys getting kisses and cuddles and big hugs. She loves going on walks and is great on a leash. One of Akuna’s favorite pastimes is watching squirrels through the window. She enjoys meeting new people, but is a little cautious when meeting men for the first time. 

If you are interested in adopting/fostering Akuna, our email is info@colbertvetrescue.org. If you would like to donate towards her medical bills, our Venmo is @colbert-vetrescue."

AGE: 5 years
WEIGHT: 13 lbs
SPECIAL NEEDS: Allergies

Pablo has been with CVRS for over a year and is still looking for his forever home! He is a Jack Russell Terrier mix and about 6 years old. He is a very active guy who loves going on walks and playing with other dogs.

Life has been rough for Pablo going back and forth between rescues. He was adopted from Barrow County a couple of weeks before being surrendered to CVRS. He was surrendered the second time to us due to his underlying skin issues and barking. After further examination, we determined that Poor Little Pablo is allergic to quite a lot with dust bunnies being his biggest trigger. He will be on allergy medications for the rest of his life. 

Pablo is the sweetest little boy and gets along great with all people and children. He gets along very well with other small dogs and cats, but he seems unsure when it comes to large dogs. If you are interested in adopting Pablo, please email us at info@colbertvetrescue.org. If you would like to donate towards his extensive medical bills, our Venmo is @colbert-vetrescue."

AGE: 8 or 9 years
WEIGHT: 65 lbs

Doug is one of our rescues that has been with us for a year or longer. He was surrendered to us after a good samaritan found him wondering the streets. When he came to our rescue, his back was extremely irritated and he would get upset if anyone tried to touch it. He also was covered with fleas and heartworm positive.

After much needed TLC, including a bath, flea medication, heartworm treatment, and neutering, Doug is ready to go to his forever home! He now loves to get his back scratched and will do “Dougie Stomps” when you scratch the right spot and alternate stomping his back legs because it feels so good. Additionally, he loves going for long walks and taking in the smells and sights and, afterwards, taking a cozy nap on a pallet of soft comfy blankets. The only thing he likes more than that, is dinnertime.

Doug is our oldest resident and sometimes we call him our “grumpy old man” because he is bit selective when meeting new dogs, but he loves people and has never met a stranger. Sometimes his joints and hips get sore, but that does not stop him from doing a happy dance when he sees someone bringing his food to him! 

We are guessing Doug is some type of lab mix and about 8 or 9 years old. He is longing for a home environment where he will be showered in love and treats. If you are interested in fostering or adopting Doug, please reach out to us! Our email is info@colbertvetrescue.org.

Roscoe is one of our rescues that has been with us for a year or longer. He came from another rescue that was at capacity.

Roscoe is an extremely intelligent dog. He is very quick to pick up new tricks, and is very food motivated (which comes in handy for training). Recently, he has been learning how to walk on a leash without pulling and he has done very well! He gets along well with most other dogs, but would do better in a home without cats.

Meet Caramelo! This gentle and sweet 1.5-year-old pup weighs 40 pounds and is ready for his loving home. During a recent weekend outing, he was a bit timid getting into the car but soon enjoyed the ride and loved walking in the woods. He did well on the leash, showing curiosity while trying to dart after squirrels. Although he doesn't know commands yet and was uninterested in treats, with patience and love, he'll come out of his shell.

Caramelo needs a caring family to help him gain confidence and discover the joys of being a beloved pet! Come meet him at our shelter today!"

She also sat for treats and took them gently. Kinsley might be a great fit for a first time dog parent since she knows some commands already. Plus, she's super cute.

Say hello to McDougal and you'll never want to say good bye. He's a bit shy but very friendly and loves getting attention and pets.

He loves treats, which he takes gently and is very skinny so feel free to spoil him a little or a lot-he deserves it. He's not particularly interested in toys because he's too busy making friends with people. He'd love to be your best friend."

Meet Dill Pickle! This easygoing pup is a volunteer favorite and full of love and personality. Known for his friendly manners and playful spirit, Dill Pickle is ready to bring joy to a lucky family. Fans rave, ""DP was super easy to walk - he even jogged a bit, staying right by my side and checking in often. He's definitely had some training."" After a good walk and sniff, he's all about cuddles and pets, making him the perfect mix of active and affectionate.

Dill Pickle is polite with other dogs and people, but he does have some anxiety around cars and loud noises. Parking lots, garages, and busy streets make him nervous, though he rides calmly once he's in the car. For this reason, a quieter home with access to low-traffic walking areas or hiking trails would suit him best.

At home, Dill Pickle is both house-trained and crate-trained, with a special love for his crate as his safe space. While he was a little shy at first, some salami bribery quickly won him over, and now he's your shadow, eager to go everywhere with you. He's a polite leash walker who doesn't pull, and though he has lots of energy and loves to play (tug, catch, and wrestling are favorites), he also knows how to settle down for cozy snuggles.

She leans in for pets, sometimes so enthusiastically she might just push you over. She means no harm, she's just that full of love. Shanita has so much love to give.

Whether we're cruising to a local park, a friend's house, or just exploring new places, I'm always ready to hop in and enjoy the ride.

I'm known around here as a social butterfly. I get along well with everyone-cats, dogs, kids-you name it! I'm gentle and friendly, which makes me a great fit for any family or friend group, no matter who's included. I walk nicely on a leash, making me the perfect partner for walks on the Beltline, soaking up the sights and smells while we get some fresh air together.

If you're looking for a pup who's as good with people as they are with other furry friends, loves a good adventure but is just as happy relaxing by your side, I might just be the one for you. So let's meet up soon-I'll bring the tail wags, and you bring the treats!"

Beautiful Kara is the perfect hiking companion! She is always excited to get out of the shelter, but after a few minutes outside, she is calm and relaxed on leash. She understands and follows voice commands and while on the trail, waits politely for people and dogs to pass. In the car on the way to the park, she pulled to the end of her ""seatbelt"" so she could ride with her chin on my shoulder. On the way back, she sat quietly and looked out the window at the world she hadn't seen for almost a year.

Kara loves to play! Back at the house, she worked out the zoomies in my large yard. We played ""Chuck- It"" with a tennis ball, giving her more opportunity to run, until she raced back to me, and without slowing down, flew past me dropping the ball at my feet and taking the Chuck-It with her. Then it became a game of ""keep-away"".

At 5 years old, Kara may be mature, but she is still silly, athletic, and adventurous. She is quiet, and can be reserved when she first meets people, but once she feels comfortable, she enjoys their company and just being petted. We walked the trails at Henderson Park and she acted like we walked there together every day.

Kara prefers to be the only dog and would be an amazing addition to a family with older kids. She is affectionate, but she is not needy. You may be gifted with a lean when you pet her, or if you're lucky, a sweet kiss on the face!"

Our photo team shared that he was quite friendly and playful. He likes toys and balls and had a hard time deciding which he preferred. He knows sit, enjoys treats (which he takes politely) and is low to medium energy. Valen is a young pup, eager to find a good home. Is that yours?

She is dog friendly and enjoys playing with her doggy foster siblings. She also likes toys and bones and can entertain herself. She is nervous meeting new people, but once she is comfortable, she is loving, cuddly, and devoted. She is medium energy and nondestructive in the home.

Hello, I'm Squirt - a mother dog with a journey as vast as the love in my puppy-dog eyes. I came to the ranch with the noble duty of mothering 9 charming puppies. Though I'm somewhat of a puppy at heart, I have spent much of my life tending my babies and have not had the opportunity to be one myself. All of my little ones have found their forever homes, and now it's time for ME!
The great outdoors is where I find my joy, romping and playing. My living space is a model of cleanliness - I take pride in a tidy kennel! Taking walks is one of my favorite things but I admit I am strong and tend to pull so some training is in order. I'm eager to explore and discover new horizons alongside you.
I've made some nice connections here at BDRR and treasure the kind embraces and camaraderie. Blankets and toys bring me pleasure, particularly when the toys come filled with peanut butter - it's scrumptious!
I am ready for a forever home, just as my adorable puppies have found theirs. If you're looking for a loyal and loving companion who is great at both playing and snuggling, your search ends here. Remember...I do need some training but that gives us something fun to do together!

I am incredibly grateful to have been given a second chance at finding a loving home, and even though it's taking longer than I had hoped, I am confident that my people are out there looking for me and will come take me home soon.

Hi, I'm Spike! I'm close to 2 years old, full of energy, and I get along great with other dogs. I love to cuddle and I'm always up for some fun with my toys.
I'm a delightful hound mix with a happy face, but behind this smile is a past I am trying to overcome. I've had a bit of a tough journey. I was adopted once, but then I had to go back to the shelter through no fault of my own. Because of spacing constraints, I ended up on the euthanasia list. But I'm a real gem and lucky for me the folks at the shelter recognized that and that's when Big Dog Ranch came to my Rescue.

I have an irresistible charm and a playful nature that draws people in. I love affection and attention, and despite the challenges I've faced, I remain resilient and hopeful. I'm looking for a new chapter in my life filled with love and security.
I need a family that can offer me the affection & attention I deserve, as well as keep me busy since I have lots of energy to burn. I pray for a home where my endearing personality can truly shine and is appreciated.

Meet Bebe, a medium-high energy female pit/boxer mix with velvety fur and a perfectly wrinkly face. She is about 3-4 years old, spayed, vaccinated, and microchipped.

One of her foster's favorite things about her is the little mumbles and grumble noises she makes in the morning when she wakes up or the funny little grunts she makes when she follows the sit and wait command during our walks. She can also entertain herself with a toy on her own, and will sort of hop around and pounce on the toy and throw it up in the air for herself in the funniest and cutest way ever.

Bebe has demonstrated a high aptitude for kids and babies alike-- she loves them and is visibly happier and more excited around them, but at the same time, she knows to tamp down her excitement and energy around the little ones. She has done great with other dogs after appropriate introductions. We still need to assess what she will be like around smaller animals such as cats.

While Bebe is shy at first, once she feels safe around you she will literally melt into your arms. Physical touch is her love language, and with time and patience, she will adorably demand to be pet, scratched, rubbed, and just loved on in general.

Bebe needs a family who is active, committed, and experienced with dogs her size. She needs a family who will be committed to continuing to train her so she can continue on her successful journey of becoming the happiest dog she can be! She could use training on reactivity, resource guarding, and anxiety. Bebe has shown progress with being trained in her foster home so far, and we hope this could continue with whoever adopts her!

Bebe is an athlete who needs daily exercise to keep her calm, such as going on hikes or exploring water (apparently also knows how to swim!). At the same time, she's also good at plopping down and cuddling up with her human.

- Sleeps a lot during the day
- Sleeps in his crate
- Never barks (I have not heard him bark once in the two weeks I've had him)
- Does not get on furniture (I think because he has arthritis). He's able to jump into my car though. He has never tried to get on my couch or bed.
- Knows how to sit, learning to stay, responds best to a whistle

We're working on fetch (he just wants to chew the ball after he gets it) and a number of basic commands that he's taking to well. Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?"""

Meet Acamaro, affectionately known as Ru. He is a stunning and charming companion, overflowing with sweetness, cuddles, and playful antics.

While he may feel a bit nervous around new people, he warms up quickly, especially if he's the center of attention in a calm environment. In fact, he's already shown his affectionate side by snuggling up in his foster's bed after just a couple of nights!

With his boundless energy and zest for life, Ru is ready to join in on any adventure you have planned. He adores romping around the backyard, chasing after squirrels, and having playdates with other pups. Ru is not just a pretty face, as he's also incredibly intelligent and responsive. He's mastered commands like sit, stay, and down, making him easy to train. Although he's mostly house trained, he might get a bit anxious when left alone for a bit. But don't worry, with plenty of activity, he settles down nicely and behaves like a perfect gentleman.

This talkative husky loves to have conversations with his human friends, adding a touch of charm to every interaction. While he may need a bit of understanding during his transition period, he's sure to continue blossoming into the perfect companion for any experienced dog owner. Whether it's hiking in the great outdoors or going for a run, Ru is up for any adventure you have in mind. While he's not a fan of crates, he's adaptable and eager to please, making him a delightful addition to any loving home."

But he is oh so friendly and will make a wonderful companion. Here is what his foster has to say about him:

""Debonair is a VERY SWEET 5 yo boy, approx. 55 lbs. He is so calm, all he wants is to be in the same room as his human buddy. He follows me around all day. Since we brought him home, he has been nothing but an ideal dog.

Deb is calm-natured, good with our dog, and listens to commands well. He's very well behaved-on walks (no pulling on the leash), but he does get scared of loud noises like busy traffic. I think it would benefit him to be in a quiet home where he can be around people during the day. Gets along well with our dog. Does not bark at all- at other dogs on the street or motorcycles passing by or the mail truck!""

Spring is the prettiest sight you'll ever see.

Spring has sprung early, and it comes with four paws! This playful 1.5-year-old, 52lbs sweetheart brings with her the joy of a new season. Forget blooming flowers, Spring is the prettiest sight you'll ever see. She walks beautifully on a leash, but don't be surprised if she stops to soak up the sunshine with a contented sigh. Treats are tempting, but affection truly makes her heart sing. Spring's love for you is constant and true. Open your home to this ray of sunshine and watch her blossom into the perfect pet!

70524173,Ms. Sasha,Mixed Breed,,False,Adult,Female,Large,,,,Dekalb County Animal Services,GA423,30341,3,,,,,False,"Chamblee, GA",N/A,N/A,Spayed / neutered.,"Meet Ms. Sasha
Ms. Sasha is calm and easygoing and just loves getting affection from humans. She's very friendly in a low-key, not in your face,way. That's good since she's 63 lbs and volunteers say she's very easy to walk. She makes the cutest play bows and can play gently with a soft toy. She seems housetrained and knows her sit command. One volunteer thought Ms. Sasha would do fine with her elderly mother just because she's so calm. Bonus: She gives lots of kisses. This is one precious dog. If you're looking for calm and cuddly, Ms.Sasha is the one to take home."

Taz is the best! He's playful and does the cutest play bows over and over and just wants friends to play with him. He has an adorable face, very perky ears, and the cutest brown freckles on his white legs and belly. He also enjoys pets and snuggles. This boy absolutely LOVES to run and play but he doesn't jump on people, which is incredible! He's done really well with other dogs in playgroup, so he would likely do well with a doggy sibling at home! Come adopt this lover today!

A polygon is a closed geometric shape but our Polygon doesn't know or care. He does know that in Greek ""poly"" means ""many"" and if so he has ""poly"" qualities that make him a very good boy! Look at his cream-colored puffy fur and great smile. Polygon is a bit shy at first but loves treats, affection, and belly rubs. Please meet him and take him home!"
70408822,Jia - IN FOSTER,Mixed Breed,,False,Adult,Female,Medium,,,,Dekalb County Animal Services,GA423,30341,3,,,,,False,"Chamblee, GA",N/A,N/A,Spayed / neutered.,"Meet Jia - IN FOSTER
Jia is a smallish dark brindle and white girl. This kissy thing is playful with other dogs in our playgroup. She loves treats which is great for training. She is low to medium energy and with her smaller size and dog friendliness could be great in an apartment or condo. Her markings are absolutely lovely--she's a stunner. She is not toy obsessed but during her photo shoot she burst into zoomies and grabbed one and played with it. It was so funny to watch. She is also good on leash. Come for the kisses, leave with the cute girl. https://youtu.be/m8wntvnvYro"
