    "\n",
    "This project involves collecting and analyzing data related to adoptable dogs from Petfinder.com, a reputable online database of animals who need homes. The data was collected on October 24th, 2024 using web scraping techniques to gather information on dogs available for adoption in a specific region."

    "### Data Collected\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information was collected for each dog:\n",
    "- Pet ID: A unique identifier assigned by Petfinder\n",
    "- Name: The name given to the dog by the shelter or rescue organization\n",
    "- Primary Breed: The primary breed of the dog\n",
    "- Secondary Breed: The secondary breed of the dog\n",
    "- Mixed Breed: An indicator (e.g, Yes or No) showing whether the dog is of mixed breed\n",
    "- Age: Categorized as Baby, Young, Adult, or Senior\n",
    "- Sex: Male or Female\n",
    "- Size: The size category of the dog, such as Small, Medium, Large, or Extra Large\n",
    "- Primary Colour: The predominant color of the dog's coat\n",
    "- Secondary Colour: The secondary color present in the dog's coat, if any\n",
    "- Coat Length: The length of the dog's coat, categorized as Hairless, Short, Medium, or Long\n",
    "- Shelter Name: The name of the shelter or rescue organization currently caring for the dog\n",
    "- Zip Code: The postal code of the shelter's location\n",
    "- Number of Photos: The number of photos available for the dog in its listing\n",
    "- Children: An indicator of whether the dog is suitable for homes with children\n",
    "- Cats: An indicator of whether the dog gets along well with cats\n",
    "- Other Dogs: An indicator of whether the dog is friendly towards other dogs\n",
    "- Characteristics: Descriptive traits and personality attributes of the dog\n",
    "- House Trained: An indicator of whether the dog is trained to eliminate outside or in designated areas\n",
    "- Health: Information regarding the dog's health status, including vaccinations, spay/neuter status, and any special needs\n",
    "- Adoption Fee: The cost associated with adopting the dog, when available\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I am collecting all available data for each dog and will refine the scope during the analysis phase once I determine the specific questions I want to address."

    "### Decisions to Restrict Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope Limitation: For proof of concept purposes, data was only collected for adoptable dogs in Atlanta, GA and only three pages worth of data were pulled (119 observations)\n",
    "- Respecting Terms of Service: Ensured that the scraping process complied with Petfinder's terms of use and robots.txt file\n",
    "- Error Handling: Implemented exception handling to manage unexpected issues without causing undue strain on the website\n",
    "- Duplicate Avoidance: Implemented checks to prevent collecting duplicate entries, ensuring each pet is uniquely represented\n",
    "- Data Validation: Included steps to validate and clean data, such as handling missing values and standardizing formats"
